            "answer": "A)5(√3 + 1)",
            "explanation": "Explanation :\nLet the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/√3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)\nh / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)\nSo, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\nAnswer : A",
            "output": "StepThought: Let the distance between the car and the base of the tower be x and the height of the tower be h. Then, we have:\n\ntan 45° = h/x\ntan 60° = h/(x + d)\n\nwhere d is the distance covered by the car in the additional time taken to reach the base of the tower.\n\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n\nx = h\nx + d = h/√3\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\nd = h(√3 - 1)\n\nNow, we know that the car takes 10 minutes to cover the distance from x to x + d while the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°. This means that the car covers a distance of d/√3 in 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken to reach the base of the tower is:\n\nt = 10 + d/(v√3)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the car. But we know that the car is moving at a uniform speed, so we can write:\n\nd = vt\n\nSubstituting this in the previous equation, we get:\n\nt = 10 + d/(v√3) = 10 + vt/(v√3) = 10 + t/√3\n\nSolving for t, we get:\n\nt = 7(√3 - 1)\n\nTherefore, the answer is: {Answer: C)7(√3 – 1)}.\n"

We don't know the probability of A and B occurring together, so we need to find an upper bound for P(A and B). The greatest value for P(A and B) is the minimum of P(A) and P(B), which is 0.56.

So, if 1 out of 20 marbles pulled out the second time was black, then the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 5% (1/20).\n\nLet's assume that the bag originally had x white marbles. After 20 marbles were pulled out and painted black, the bag had (x+20) marbles, out of which 20 were black. So, the number of white marbles in the bag after the first round is (x+20-20) = x.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of marbles in the bag after the second round. We know that the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 5%, so the number of black marbles in the bag is 5% of the total number of marbles. Let's assume that the total number of marbles in the bag after the second round is Q. Then, the number of black marbles in the bag is 0.05Q.\n\nIn the second round, 20 marbles were pulled out and returned to the bag. So, the number of black marbles in the bag after the second round is (0.05Q+1) and the number of white marbles in the bag after the second round is (Q-0.05Q-1) = 0.95Q-1.\n\nWe know that the number of white marbles in the bag after the first round is x. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\nx = 0.95Q-1\n\nSolving for Q, we get:\n\nQ = (x+1)/0.95\n\nSubstituting x=20 (since there were originally 20 marbles in the bag), we get:\n\nQ = (20+1)/0.95 = 21.05/0.95 = 22.16\n\nRounding up to the nearest whole number, we get:\n\nQ = 23\n\nTherefore, the answer is: {Answer: D)400}.\n"

So, we can try different values of y to find the corresponding value of x.\nIf y = 6, then x = 17(6) - 82 = 10, which is a valid solution.\nTherefore, Jack bought 10 brown sharpeners and 8 white sharpeners.\nThe answer is: {Answer: \"A)10,8\"}.\n"

            "answer": "A)8",
            "explanation": "Since hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, then in 2 + 3 = 5 hours it will fill 5/8th of the pool. Thus the remaining 3/8th is filled by hose B in 3 hours. This means that hose B,working alone, to fill the entire pool will need 3*8/3 = 8 hours.\nAnswer: A.",
            "output": "StepThought: First, we need to find the rate at which hose A fills the pool. We know that it takes 8 hours for hose A to fill the pool alone, so its rate is 1/8 of the pool per hour. \n\nNext, we need to find the rate at which the two hoses fill the pool together. We know that hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours, so it filled 2/8 or 1/4 of the pool. That means that the remaining 3/4 of the pool was filled by both hoses working together in 3 hours. \n\nLet's use the formula: rate x time = work. \n\nFor hose A alone, we have: \n1/8 x 2 = 1/4 \n\nFor both hoses working together, we have: \n(1/8 + rate of hose B) x 3 = 3/4 \n\nSimplifying the second equation: \n3/8 + 3(rate of hose B) = 3/4 \n3(rate of hose B) = 3/4 - 3/8 \n3(rate of hose B) = 3/8 \nrate of hose B = 1/8 \n\nSo, hose B fills the pool at a rate of 1/8 of the pool per hour. \n\nFinally, we can use the formula rate x time = work again to find how long it would take hose B to fill the entire pool alone: \n1/8 x time = 3/4 \ntime = (3/4) / (1/8) \ntime = 6 \n\nTherefore, it would take hose B, working alone, 6 hours to fill the entire pool. \n\nThe answer is: {Answer: D)6}.\n"

We know that:\n\n- 24% of all students are members of both clubs, so S + C - 24% represents the percentage of students who are members of only one club (or neither).\n- 20% of swim team members are not in the chess club, so the percentage of students who are in both clubs is 80% of the percentage of students who are in the swim team: 0.8S.\n\nPutting these together, we can write an equation:\n\nS + C - 24% = 0.8S\n\nSolving for C, we get:\n\nC = 0.2S + 24%\n\nWe want to find S, so we need another equation.

            "output": "StepThought: Let's first find the fraction of work done by each painter in a day:\nMr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can paint 1/6 of a house in a day.\nMr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 1/8 of a house in a day.\nMr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so he can paint 1/12 of a house in a day.\n\nAfter 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, so only Mr. Black is working for the next 6 days. In these 6 days, Mr. Black will complete 6*(1/8) = 3/4 of a house.\n\nSo, in the first 8 days, the three painters together would have completed:\n8*(1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12) = 8*(4/24 + 3/24 + 2/24) = 8*(9/24) = 3 houses*(9/24) = 9/8 houses\n\nAfter Mr. Black works for 6 days, the total work completed would be:\n9/8 + 6*(1/8) = 9/8 + 3/4 = 27/16 houses\n\nNow, we need to find how many days Mr. Blue would take to complete the remaining work of (3 - 27/16) = 9/16 houses. Let's call this number of days \"d\".\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\nd*(1/12) = 9/16\nd = (9/16)*(12) = 27/4 = 6.75\n\nTherefore, it would take Mr. Blue 6.75 days to complete the contract.\n\nThe answer is: {Answer: C)10}.\n"

Therefore, the total investment made by C is:\n\n120,000 * (12-x) = 1,440,000 - 120,000x\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of profit sharing between A, B, and C.

So, if we have 6x grams of alloy X, we have 2x grams of zinc and 3x grams of copper.\n\nSimilarly, for alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which can be simplified to 2:3.

He needs to borrow $20 000 = $800 = $19 200. He would borrow this money on day 30 and repay it on day 100 (the day the original invoice is due) resulting in a 70-day loan.

We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation: \n\n2x + 3y - (2x + 4y) = 300 - 300 \n\n-y = -150 \n\ny = 150 \n\nNow we can substitute y = 150 into either equation to solve for x.

We need to find the value of n.\n\nWe also know that there are 45 different ways to select two balls from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected.\n\nLet's consider the two cases:\n\nCase 1: Ball 3 is not included in the box\nIn this case, there are n-1 balls in the box, marked from 1 to n-1. The number of ways to select two balls from this box is given by the formula n-1 choose 2, which is (n-1)(n-2)/2. We know that this number is equal to 45. So we have:\n\n(n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n(n-1)(n-2) = 90\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\nn^2 - 3n + 2 = 90\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nn^2 - 3n - 88 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nn = (3 ± sqrt(3^2 + 4*88))/2\n\nn = (3 ± sqrt(361))/2\n\nn = (3 ± 19)/2\n\nn = 11 or n = -8\n\nSince n cannot be negative, we have n = 11.\n\nCase 2: Ball 3 is included in the box\nIn this case, there are n balls in the box, marked from 1 to n. We need to subtract the number of ways to select two balls from the box such that ball 3 is included. The number of ways to select ball 3 and one other ball is n-1. So the number of ways to select two balls from the box such that ball 3 is included is (n-1) - (n-1) = 0. Therefore, the total number of ways to select two balls from the box is (n choose 2) - 0 = n(n-1)/2.\n\nWe know that this number is equal to 45.
