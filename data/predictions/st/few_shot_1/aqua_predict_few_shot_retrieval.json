            "answer": "A)5(√3 + 1)",
            "explanation": "Explanation :\nLet the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/√3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)\nh / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)\nSo, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\nAnswer : A",
            "output": "StepThought: Let the height of the tower be h and the distance between the car and the base of the tower be x. Then we have:\n\ntan 45° = h/x\ntan 60° = h/(x + vt), where v is the speed of the car and t is the time it takes to reach the base of the tower.\n\nSimplifying the second equation, we get:\n\n√3 = h/(x + vt)\n\nWe can eliminate h by equating the two expressions for tan:\n\nx = h\nx + vt = h/√3\n\nSubstituting x = h into the second equation, we get:\n\nh = vt/(√3 - 1)\n\nWe know that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°, so we have:\n\ntan 45° = h/x\ntan 60° = h/(x + vt/6)\n\nSubstituting h in terms of v and t, we get:\n\n1 = vt/(x(√3 - 1))\n√3 = vt/[(x + vt/6)(√3 - 1)]\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = vt/(2√3 - 3)\n\nWe want to find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower, which is when x = 0. Substituting x = 0, we get:\n\nt = 3h/(2v√3)\n\nSubstituting h in terms of v and t, we get:\n\nt = 3v/(2(√3 - 1))\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nt = 6(√3 + √2)\n\nTherefore, the answer is: {Answer: B)6(√3 + √2)}.\n"

Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.\n=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.\n=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)\n=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x\n=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x\n=> y = 315 - (9/7)x\n=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,\nx = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153\nx = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144\nx = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135\nx = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126\nAs we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs.

Let's assume that they both worked for the same number of hours, which we can call h. \n\nSo, we can set up the following equation: \n\nx/7 + y/9 = h \n\nWe can also use the fact that x+y=35 to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. For example, we can solve for y: \n\ny = 35 - x \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for y into the equation we set up earlier: \n\nx/7 + (35-x)/9 = h \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n9x + 7(35-x) = 63h \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx = (63h - 245)/2 \n\nNow we can use the fact that x+y=35 to solve for y: \n\ny = 35 - x \n\nSubstituting the expression we found for x, we get: \n\ny = (245 - 63h)/2 \n\nWe want to find out how many toys Jacob made, so we need to find the value of y. We know that both Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours, so we can assume that h is some value close to the average of 7 and 9, which is 8. \n\nSubstituting h=8 into the expressions we found for x and y, we get: \n\nx = 7 \ny = 28 \n\nTherefore, Jacob made 28 toys. \n\nThe answer is: {Answer: \"C)17\"}\n"

            "output": "StepThought: Explanation:\nLet's assume the total number of students is x.\nThen, the number of students studying math = 1/16 x\nThe number of students studying bio = 1/10 x\nThe number of students studying English = 1/8 x\n\nTo find the maximum number of students, we need to add all three fractions together:\n1/16 x + 1/10 x + 1/8 x = (5 + 8 + 4)/80 x = 17/80 x\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students = 17/80 x\n\nTo find the minimum number of students, we need to assume that there is no overlap between the students studying each subject. This means that the total number of students is the sum of the three fractions:\n1/16 x + 1/10 x + 1/8 x = (5 + 8 + 10)/80 x = 23/80 x\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of students = 23/80 x\n\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:\n17/80 x - 23/80 x = -6/80 x = -3/40 x\n\nSince x is a 4-digit number, it must be between 1000 and 9999. Let's assume x = 1000 to find the minimum and maximum number of students:\nMinimum number of students = 23/80 x 1000 = 287.5\nMaximum number of students = 17/80 x 1000 = 212.5\n\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:\n212.5 - 287.5 = -75\n\nSince the difference is negative, we need to assume a larger value of x. Let's assume x = 8000:\nMinimum number of students = 23/80 x 8000 = 2300\nMaximum number of students = 17/80 x 8000 = 2125\n\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:\n2125 - 2300 = -175\n\nAgain, the difference is negative, so we need to assume an even larger value of x. Let's assume x = 16000:\nMinimum number of students = 23/80 x 16000 = 4600\nMaximum number of students = 17/80 x 16000 = 4250\n\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:\n4250 - 4600 = -350\n\nOnce again, the difference is negative, so we need to assume an even larger value of x. Let's assume x = 32000:\nMinimum number of students = 23/80 x 32000 = 9200\nMaximum number of students = 17/80 x 32000 = 8500\n\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:\n8500 - 9200 = -700\n\nSince the difference is negative, we need to assume an even larger value of x. Let's assume x = 64000:\nMinimum number of students = 23/80 x 64000 = 18400\nMaximum number of students = 17/80 x 64000 = 17000\n\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:\n17000 - 18400 = -1400\n\nFinally, we have a positive difference.

Let's use the formula: rate x time = work. \n\nIf hose B fills the entire pool in x hours, then its rate is 1/x of the pool per hour. \n\nWe know that the total work done is 1, and we know that hose A filled 1/4 of the pool in 2 hours, so the remaining 3/4 of the pool was filled in 3 hours by both hoses working together. \n\nUsing the formula: \n\n(1/8) x 2 + (1/4) x 3 + (1/x) x t = 1 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n1/4 + 3/4 + (t/x) = 1 \n\nt/x = 1/4 \n\nt = x/4 \n\nWe know that t is the time it would take hose B to fill the entire pool alone, so we can substitute t = x/4 into the equation: \n\nt/x = 1/4 \n\n(x/4)/x = 1/4 \n\nx = 16 \n\nTherefore, it would take hose B, working alone, 16 hours to fill the entire pool. \n\nThe answer is: {\"Answer\": \"B)15\"}.\n"

            "explanation": "Number of paper bought on monday = x\n# of paper bought on sunday = 2x\nTotal cost = 210 = 6*x(rest of the day cost)+8*x (sunday cost)\n14x = 210\nx = 15\nAns A",
            "output": "StepThought: Let's start by finding the number of newspapers bought on Sunday and the rest of the days of the week. Let's call the number of newspapers bought on Sunday \"x\" and the number bought on the rest of the days of the week \"y\". \n\nWe know that the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, so we can write:\n\nx = 2y\n\nWe also know that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers. On Sunday, the hotel pays $4 per newspaper, and on the rest of the days of the week, it pays $1 per newspaper. So we can write:\n\n4x + 1y(6) = 210\n\nSubstituting x = 2y into the second equation, we get:\n\n4(2y) + 1y(6) = 210\n8y + 6y = 210\n14y = 210\ny = 15\n\nSo the hotel buys 15 newspapers on each of the rest of the days of the week. We also know that x = 2y, so x = 30. Therefore, the hotel buys a total of 30 + 15(6) = 120 newspapers per week. \n\nSince the hotel buys the same number of newspapers each day of the week, it buys 120/7 newspapers per day. Since it buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does on the rest of the days of the week, it buys 2(120/7) = 240/7 newspapers on Sunday. \n\nTherefore, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday. \n\nAnswer: {Answer: A)15}.\n"

This means that for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts of copper. So, if we have 6x grams of alloy X, we have 2x grams of zinc and 3x grams of copper.\n\nSimilarly, for alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which can be simplified to 2:3. This means that for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts of copper. So, if we have 7y grams of alloy Y, we have 2y grams of zinc and 3y grams of copper.\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z by adding the amounts from alloy X and Y. We have 40 grams of alloy X, which means we have 2/5 * 40 = 16 grams of zinc and 3/5 * 40 = 24 grams of copper. We also have 60 grams of alloy Y, which means we have 2/18 * 60 = 20/3 grams of zinc and 3/18 * 60 = 10 grams of copper.\n\nAdding these amounts, we get a total of 16 + 20/3 = 68/3 grams of zinc and 24 + 10 = 34 grams of copper in alloy Z.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 68/3 : 34, which can be simplified to 20:3.\n\nThe answer is: {Answer: C)59:90}.\n"

            "output": "StepThought: We can take numbers, as the price of a copper coin is 20 cents and the price of a brass coin is 25 cents. Let's assume that the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.\n\nNow we can determine quickly that the total amount should be $3.40, so we can write the equation:\n\n0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of copper coins, so we can start by assuming that the diver brought only copper coins. In this case, the equation becomes:\n\n0.20x = 3.40\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 17\n\nBut this is not a valid answer, as the question asks for the minimum number of copper coins. So we need to try other possibilities.\n\nLet's assume that the diver brought one brass coin. In this case, the equation becomes:\n\n0.20x + 0.25 = 3.40\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 16\n\nThis is a valid answer, as the diver brought at least one brass coin. But we need to check if there is a possibility of bringing fewer copper coins.\n\nLet's assume that the diver brought two brass coins. In this case, the equation becomes:\n\n0.20x + 0.50 = 3.40\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 13\n\nThis is a valid answer, and it is the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: {\"Answer\": \"C)2\"}.\n"

            "output": "StepThought: First, we need to find out what percentage of the revenue came from the sale of biographies. We know that 34% came from the sale of novels, so the remaining percentage is 100% - 34% = 66%. \n\nNext, we know that 1/3 of the remaining revenue came from the sale of biographies. To find out what percentage this represents, we can multiply 66% by 1/3: \n\n66% x 1/3 = 22% \n\nSo 22% of the revenue came from the sale of biographies. \n\nNow we can compare the revenue from the sale of novels to the revenue from the sale of biographies. We know that the revenue from the sale of novels was 34% of the total revenue. To find out how many times greater this is than the revenue from the sale of biographies, we can divide 34% by 22%: \n\n34% ÷ 22% = 1.545 \n\nSo the revenue from the sale of novels was approximately 1.5 times greater than the revenue from the sale of biographies. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: {Answer: \"B)1.5\"}.\n"

            "explanation": "Explanation:\nSuppose the merchant will take advantage of the cash discount of 4% of $20 000 = $800 by paying the bill within 30 days from the date of invoice. He needs to borrow $20 000 = $800 = $19 200. He would borrow this money on day 30 and repay it on day 100 (the day the original invoice is due) resulting in a 70-day loan. The interest he should be willing to pay on borrowed money should not exceed the cash discount $800.\nr=I/pt=21.73%\nThe highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 21.73%. This is a break-even rate. If he can borrow money, say at a rate of 15%, he should do so. He would borrow $19 200 for 70 days at 15%. Maturity value of the loan is $19 200(1+0.15(70/365))=$19 752.33\nsavings would be $20 000 − $19 752.33 = $247.67\nAnswer: A",
            "output": "StepThought: The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days, or he can pay the full amount within n days and get a 0% discount. \n\nTo calculate the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money, we need to compare the cost of borrowing with the cost of the discount. \n\nIf the merchant pays within 30 days, he will get a discount of 4% of $20,000, which is $800. So he will only have to pay $19,200. \n\nIf he borrows money to pay for the boat, he will have to pay interest on the loan. Let's say he borrows $19,200 and has to pay it back within 30 days. \n\nThe formula for simple interest is: \n\nI = P * r * t \n\nwhere I is the interest, P is the principal (the amount borrowed), r is the interest rate, and t is the time (in years). \n\nIn this case, t is 30/365 (30 days out of a 365-day year). We want to find the highest interest rate (r) that the merchant can afford to pay. \n\nSo we can rearrange the formula to solve for r: \n\nr = I / (P * t) \n\nWe know that I = $800 (the cost of the discount), P = $19,200 (the amount borrowed), and t = 30/365. \n\nr = 800 / (19,200 * 30/365) \n\nr = 0.4167 or 41.67% \n\nSo the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 41.67%. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: {\"Answer\": \"None of these\"} as none of the options match the calculated answer.\n"

For example, if x=1 and y=2, then L(x,y) = [1] + [2] + [3] = 6 and R(x,y) = [2] + [4] = 6.\n\nNow let's consider the case where x and y are not integers.

This can be done using combinations: \n\nC(11,3) = 165 \n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to select 3 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $4. We can do this by considering the different combinations of candy bars that we can select: \n\n- Selecting three $2 candy bars: C(4,3) = 4 \n- Selecting two $2 candy bars and one $1 candy bar: C(4,2) * C(4,1) = 24 \n- Selecting one $2 candy bar and two $1 candy bars: C(4,1) * C(4,2) = 24 \n\nSo the total number of ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost of more than $4 is: \n\n4 + 24 + 24 = 52 \n\nTherefore, the answer is: {\"Answer\": \"C)46\"}.\n"
