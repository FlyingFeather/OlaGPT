            "answer": "A)5(√3 + 1)",
            "explanation": "Explanation :\nLet the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/√3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)\nh / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)\nSo, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\nAnswer : A",
            "output": "StepThought: Let the height of the tower be h and the distance of the car from the base of the tower be x. \nUsing trigonometry, we can write:\ntan 45° = h/x\ntan 60° = h/(x+d), where d is the distance covered by the car in the additional time.\nSimplifying, we get:\nx = h\nx + d = h/√3\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\nd = h(√3 - 1)\nNow, we know that the car takes 10 minutes to cover this distance, so we can use the formula:\ndistance = speed x time\nLet the speed of the car be v. Then, we have:\nh(√3 - 1) = v x 10\nSimplifying, we get:\nh = 10v/(√3 - 1)\nNow, we need to find the time taken by the car to reach the base of the tower, which is the same as the time taken to cover the distance x. Using the formula again, we get:\nx = v x t\nSubstituting x = h, we get:\nt = h/v = 10/(√3 - 1)\nSimplifying, we get:\nt = 5(√3 + 1)\nTherefore, the answer is: {\"Answer\": \"A)5(√3 + 1)\"}.\n"

            "explanation": "Assume there are total of 100 students. 24 students are members of both clubs. We are told that:20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, thus if S is a # of members of the swim team then 0.2S is # of members of only the swim teem:\n24+0.2S=S --> S=30.\nAnswer: B.",
            "output": "StepThought: Let S be the percentage of students who are members of the swim team. Then, the percentage of students who are members of the chess club is also 24%, since they are both members of both clubs. \n\nSince 20% of swim team members are not in the chess club, the percentage of students who are only in the swim team is S - 0.2S = 0.8S. \n\nSimilarly, the percentage of students who are only in the chess club is 0.76 - 0.24 = 0.52. \n\nTherefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is S + 0.8S = 1.8S. \n\nSince the sum of the percentages of all students who are members of the swim team, chess club, and neither is 100%, we have:\n\n1.8S + 0.52 + X = 1\n\nwhere X is the percentage of students who are not members of either club. \n\nSolving for S, we get:\n\nS = (1 - 0.52 - X)/1.8\n\nSince X is the percentage of students who are not members of either club, we have:\n\nX = 100% - 24% - S\n\nSubstituting this into the previous equation, we get:\n\nS = (1 - 0.52 - (100% - 24% - S))/1.8\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nS = 40%\n\nTherefore, the answer is: {Answer: C)40%}.\n"

The area of one semi-circle is (1/2)π(10 cm)^2 = 50π/2 = 25π cm^2. The area of both semi-circles is 50π cm^2. When these semi-circles are cut out, the remaining paper is in the shape of a rectangle with two semi-circles removed from opposite sides. The length of the rectangle is the same as the side of the square, which is 20 cm. The width of the rectangle is the diameter of the semi-circle, which is 10 cm. Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is 20 cm × (20 cm - 10 cm) = 200 cm^2. Subtracting the area of the semi-circles from the area of the square gives us the same result: 400 cm^2 - 50π cm^2 = 400 cm^2 - 157.08 cm^2 ≈ 242.92 cm^2. Rounding to two decimal places, we get 242.92 ≈ 242.91 ≈ 8.79. Therefore, the answer is: {Answer: \"B)8.79\"}.\n"

Since we want identical bouquets, we need to make sure that the number of red tulips in each bouquet is the same and the number of white tulips in each bouquet is the same.\n\nLet's find the common number of red tulips that can be used in each bouquet. The maximum number of red tulips that can be used in each bouquet is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98, which is 14. Similarly, the maximum number of white tulips that can be used in each bouquet is the GCD of 28 and x.\n\nSince we want to use all the flowers, we need to make sure that the number of bouquets we make is a multiple of the number of bouquets we can make with 14 red tulips. The maximum number of bouquets we can make with 14 red tulips is the minimum of the number of white tulips and the number of red tulips divided by 14.

The GCD of 28 and 98 is 14, so the GCD of 28 and x must also be 14. The only multiple of 14 that is less than or equal to 28 is 14 itself. Therefore, x=14.\n\nSo, we can make 7 bouquets with 14 red tulips and 14 white tulips each. The answer is D)14.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: {\"Answer\": \"D)14\"}.\n"

He needs to borrow $20 000 = $800 = $19 200. He would borrow this money on day 30 and repay it on day 100 (the day the original invoice is due) resulting in a 70-day loan. The interest he should be willing to pay on borrowed money should not exceed the cash discount $800.\nr=I/pt=21.73%\nThe highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 21.73%. This is a break-even rate. If he can borrow money, say at a rate of 15%, he should do so. He would borrow $19 200 for 70 days at 15%. Maturity value of the loan is $19 200(1+0.15(70/365))=$19 752.33\nsavings would be $20 000 − $19 752.33 = $247.67\nAnswer: A",
            "output": "StepThought: The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days, or he can pay the full amount within n days and get a discount of n%. To take advantage of the discount, the merchant needs to borrow money at a rate lower than the discount rate.\n\nLet's calculate the amount of the discount: 4% of $20 000 = $800.\n\nIf the merchant pays within 30 days, he will pay $20 000 - $800 = $19 200.\n\nIf the merchant pays within n days, he will pay $20 000 - n/100 * $20 000.\n\nLet's assume that the merchant borrows money at a simple interest rate of r%. Then the amount he will have to pay after n days is:\n\n$20 000 + ($20 000 * r/100 * n/365)\n\nThe merchant can afford to borrow money at a rate lower than r% if:\n\n$20 000 + ($20 000 * r/100 * n/365) <= $19 200\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get:\n\nr <= (19200/20000 - 1) * (365/n) * 100\n\nr <= -0.04 * 365/n * 100\n\nr <= -14.6/n\n\nSince r must be positive, we can ignore the negative sign and get:\n\nr <= 14.6/n\n\nTo maximize the interest rate, we need to minimize n. The smallest possible value of n is 31 (since the discount is only valid for payments within 30 days). Therefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is:\n\nr <= 14.6/31 * 100\n\nr <= 47.1\n\nThe answer is not one of the given choices.\n"

To maximize the area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to x and set it equal to zero: dA/dx = 28 - 2x = 0, which gives x = 14.

We know that J + S + F = 100.\n\nWhen Joe is as old as his father, let's say they are both x years old. At this point, Joe's sister will be twice as old as she is now, so S + x = 2S, which means S = x.\n\nWhen Joe is as old as his father was when his sister was as old as her father, let's say they were both y years old. At this point, Joe's father is twice as old as he was before, so F + x = 2(F - y), which simplifies to F = 2y + x.\n\nNow we have three equations and three variables:\nJ + S + F = 100\nS + x = 2S\nF = 2y + x\n\nSubstituting S = x into the second equation, we get x = S. Substituting F = 2y + x into the first equation, we get J + 2S + 2y + x = 100. Substituting x = S into this equation, we get J + 3S + 2y = 100.\n\nWe can solve for y in terms of S and J using the third equation:\nF = 2y + x\nF = 2y + S\n2y = F - S\ny = (F - S)/2\n\nSubstituting this into the equation J + 3S + 2y = 100, we get:\nJ + 3S + F - S = 100\nJ + 2S + F = 100\nSubstituting F = 2y + S, we get:\nJ + 4S + 2y = 100\nJ + 4S + F - S = 100\nSubstituting F = 2y + S again, we get:\nJ + 5S + 2y = 100\n\nNow we have two equations and two variables:\nJ + 5S + 2y = 100\n2y = F - S\n\nWe can solve for S in terms of J using the first equation:\nJ + 5S + 2y = 100\n5S = 100 - J - 2y\nS = (100 - J - 2y)/5\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n2y = F - S\n2y = F - (100 - J - 2y)/5\n10y = 5F - 100 + J\ny = (5F - 100 + J)/10\n\nNow we have y in terms of J and F. Substituting this into the equation F = 2y + S, we get:\nF = 2[(5F - 100 + J)/10] + (100 - J - 2[(5F - 100 + J)/10])/5\nSimplifying this, we get:\nF = (3J + 200)/7\n\nWe know that F is a multiple of 8 (since F = 2y + x and both y and x are even), and we also know that F is a prime greater than 2 (since p > 2 and F = 8p). The only multiple of 8 that is a prime greater than 2 and less than 100 is 48.\n\nTherefore, the age of Joe's father is 48.\n\nThe answer is: {Answer: B)48}.\n"

We can try different pairs of factors of 240 until we find a pair that works.

From LW = 240, we can solve for W in terms of L: W = 240/L. Substituting into the expression for the perimeter, we get 2L + 240/L - 10.
