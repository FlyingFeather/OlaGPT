            "explanation": "Explanation :\nLet the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/√3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)\nh / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)\nSo, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\nAnswer : A",

Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,\nx = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153\nx = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144\nx = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135\nx = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126\nAs we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs.
