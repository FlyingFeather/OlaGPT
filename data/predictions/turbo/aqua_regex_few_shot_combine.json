            "output": "GPT: Solution:\n\nThe area of the square paper is:\n\n20 cm x 20 cm = 400 cm²\n\nThe diameter of each semi-circle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. Therefore, the radius of each semi-circle is:\n\n20 cm ÷ 2 = 10 cm\n\nThe area of each semi-circle is:\n\n1/2 x π x 10² = 50π cm²\n\nThe total area of both semi-circles is:\n\n2 x 50π cm² = 100π cm²\n\nWhen the two semi-circles are cut out, the remaining paper is in the shape of a square with two quarter-circles removed. The area of this remaining paper is:\n\n400 cm² - 100π cm²\n\nWe can use a calculator to approximate the value of π:\n\nπ ≈ 3.14\n\nTherefore:\n\n400 cm² - 100π cm² ≈ 400 cm² - 314 cm²\n\n400 cm² - 100π cm² ≈ 86 cm²\n\nSo the area of the remaining paper is approximately 86 cm².\n\nThe closest answer choice is C)8.75, which is equal to 87.5 cm².

            "output": "GPT: Answer: D)4 step/minute. \n\nExplanation: Let's assume the total number of steps in the staircase is 'x'. \nAccording to the problem, if you walk 20 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 10 minutes. So, your speed is 20/10 = 2 steps/minute. \nSimilarly, if you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the ground in 20 minutes. So, your speed is 10/20 = 0.5 steps/minute. \nLet's say the elevator's speed is 'y' steps/minute. \nWhen you walk 20 steps and stop, the elevator covers (x-20) steps in 10 minutes. So, the elevator's speed is (x-20)/10 steps/minute. \nWhen you walk 10 steps and stop, the elevator covers (x-10) steps in 20 minutes. So, the elevator's speed is (x-10)/20 steps/minute. \nNow, equating both the elevator speeds, we get: \n(x-20)/10 = (x-10)/20 \nSolving this equation, we get x = 60. \nSo, the total number of steps in the staircase is 60. \nNow, substituting x = 60 in the elevator speeds equation, we get: \n(y = (x-20)/10) and (y = (x-10)/20) \nSolving these equations, we get y = 4 steps/minute. \nTherefore, the speed of the elevator is 4 steps/minute. \nHence, the answer is: {Answer: D)4 step/minute}.\n",

Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.\n=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.\n=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)\n=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x\n=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x\n=> y = 315 - (9/7)x\n=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,\nx = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153\nx = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144\nx = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135\nx = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126\nAs we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y/9 = 135/9 = 15.\nAnswer: A",
            "output": "GPT: Let the number of toys made by Alex be x.\nThen, the number of toys made by Jacob will be (35-x).\nAs per the question, the time taken by Alex and Jacob to make a toy is in the ratio of 7:9.\nLet the time taken by Alex be 7y and the time taken by Jacob be 9y.\nTherefore, the number of toys made by Alex and Jacob in 1 hour will be (1/7y) and (1/9y) respectively.\nAs both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that the ratio of the number of toys made by them will be equal to the ratio of the time taken by them.\nSo, we have:\nx/(7y) = (35-x)/(9y)\nSolving this equation, we get:\nx = 15\nTherefore, the number of toys made by Jacob is (35-15) = 20.\nHence, the answer is: {Answer: D)18}.\n",

            "explanation": "Let x be the length of one side of the original square.\nThe area of the rectangle is x(x-4)=140.\nx=14.\nThe perimeter of the square was 4*14=56 feet.\nThe answer is A.",
            "output": "GPT: To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is (1/2) * base * height. Since we know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we can set up the equation:\n\n(1/2) * base * height = 70\n\nWe also know that the two triangles are congruent, so their bases and heights are equal. Let x be the length of the remaining side of the rectangular piece of cloth. Then the base and height of each triangle are (x-4) and x, respectively. Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:\n\n(1/2) * (x-4) * x = 70\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 and simplifying, we get:\n\nx^2 - 4x - 140 = 0\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we get:\n\n(x-14)(x+10) = 0\n\nSince x cannot be negative, we have x = 14. Therefore, the original piece of cloth had a side length of 14 + 4 = 18 feet. The perimeter of the original piece of cloth is 4 times this length, which is 72 feet. However, we only need to consider the perimeter of the remaining piece of cloth, which is 3 times the length (since one side was trimmed by 4 feet).

So, the new amount each person had to contribute was (96/x) + 4. \n\nWe can set up an equation to solve for x: \n\n96/x = (96/x) + 4 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n4/x = 4 \n\nMultiplying both sides by x, we get: \n\n4 = 4x \n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get: \n\nx = 1 \n\nThis means that only one person attended the picnic, which doesn't make sense.

Let's call this number y. \n\nThen, the amount each person would have to contribute would be 96/y. \n\nSince 4 people did not turn up, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. So, the new amount each person had to contribute was (96/y) + 4. \n\nWe can set up an equation to solve for y: \n\n96/y + 4 = 96/(y+4) \n\nMultiplying both sides by y(y+4), we get: \n\n96(y+4) + 4y(y+4) = 96y \n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get: \n\n4y^2 + 16y - 384 = 0 \n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get: \n\ny^2 + 4y - 96 = 0 \n\nFactoring this quadratic equation, we get: \n\n(y+12)(y-8) = 0 \n\nSo, y = -12 or y = 8.

            "answer": "D)53",
            "explanation": "Starting from 1 Water Lilly it takes 60 days.\nIf there are already two present, it can be taken as the first day is over.\nIt will take 59 more days.\nNotice that we are told thatthe number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days, thus if initially there were 64 water lilies instead of one, we can consider that 7 days are over and therefore only 53 days are left.\nAnswer: D.",
            "output": "GPT: Let's first find the rate of growth of water lilies per day. Since the number of lilies doubles every two days, we can say that the growth rate is 2^(1/2) or approximately 1.414. \n\nIf there is one water lily initially, after n days there will be 1.414^n lilies. We want to find the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, which means there will be 2^6 or 64 lilies initially. \n\nSo we need to solve for n in the equation 1.414^n = 64. Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get n*log(1.414) = log(64), which simplifies to n = log(64)/log(1.414). Using a calculator, we get n ≈ 29.9. \n\nTherefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in approximately 30 days. \n\nThe answer is: {Answer: C)30}.\n",

            "output": "GPT: Answer: D)215.67\nExplanation: \nThe merchant can take advantage of the discount by paying within 30 days, which means he only needs to pay 96% of the invoice amount, which is $20,000 x 0.96 = $19,200.\nTo calculate the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money, we need to find the interest he would pay on a loan of $19,200 for n days at a certain interest rate.\nLet's assume the interest rate is x%. Then the interest he would pay after n days is:\n$19,200 x (x/100) x (n/365)\nThis interest should be less than or equal to the discount he would receive, which is:\n$20,000 x 4% = $800\nSo we have the inequality:\n$19,200 x (x/100) x (n/365) ≤ $800\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\nx ≤ 80000/(19n)\nTo maximize x, we need to minimize the denominator 19n. Since n can be any number greater than 30, we can choose n = 31 to get the smallest possible denominator. Then we have:\nx ≤ 80000/(19 x 31) = 215.67\nTherefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 215.67%. \nThe answer is: {Answer: D)215.67}.\n",

            "output": "GPT: Let the common remainder be x. Then, 2272 - x and 875 - x are both divisible by N. Also, (2272 - x) - 2(875 - x) = 522 - x is divisible by N. Thus, N is a factor of 522 - x. Similarly, N is a factor of (2272 - x) - 2(522 - x) = 1228 + x. Thus, N is a factor of 522 - x and 1228 + x. Since N is a 3-digit number, it must be a factor of (1228 + x) - (522 - x) = 706 + 2x. The factors of 706 are 1, 2, 353, and 706. Checking each of these, we find that only 353 satisfies the conditions. Thus, N = 353 and the sum of its digits is 11. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: {\"Answer\": \"B)11\"}.\n",

            "explanation": "The sides of the rectangle have a length of 10 and L.\nThe area is 10*L=240 so L=24.\nShe needs fencing with a length of 10+2*24=58 meters.\nThe answer is A.",
            "output": "GPT: Let the length of the rectangular yard be L and the width be W.\nFrom the given information, we know that:\n- The area of the yard is LW = 240\n- She needs fencing for three sides, which would be 2L + W\n- One side of 10 meters is already unfenced, so she doesn't need fencing for that side\n\nWe can use the first equation to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. For example, we can solve for L:\nL = 240/W\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n2(240/W) + W = fencing needed\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n480/W + W = fencing needed\nTaking the derivative of this expression with respect to W and setting it equal to zero, we can find the value of W that minimizes the fencing needed:\nd/dW (480/W + W) = -480/W^2 + 1 = 0\n480/W^2 = 1\nW^2 = 480\nW = sqrt(480) = 4sqrt(30)\n\nSubstituting this value of W back into the equation for L, we get:\nL = 240/W = 240/(4sqrt(30)) = 15sqrt(30)\n\nTherefore, the fencing needed is:\n2L + W = 2(15sqrt(30)) + 4sqrt(30) = 34sqrt(30) ≈ 62.02\n\nSo the answer is: {\"Answer\": \"B)62\"}\n",
