We know that the average number sold per month was 20, so the total number sold in 10 months is 20 x 10 = 200.\n\nWe also know that the average number sold per month last year was 42. If we assume that this average held for the last 12 months of last year, then the total number sold in those 12 months would be 42 x 12 = 504.\n\nTherefore, the total number of microwave ovens sold during the entire 22 months period is 200 + 504 = 704.\n\nFinally, we divide this total by 22 to find the average number sold per month during the entire period: 704/22 = 32.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: {\"Answer\": \"D)32\"}.\n"

We can use this information to set up two equations and solve for x and y.\\n\\nLet's start with the equation for the total number of sharpeners:\\nx + y = 18\\n\\nNow let's set up the equation for the total cost:\\nx + (x+1)*y = 100\\n\\nWe can simplify this equation by distributing the y:\\nx + xy + y = 100\\n\\nNow we can use the first equation to solve for x in terms of y:\\nx = 18 - y\\n\\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\\n(18 - y) + y(1 + 1) = 100\\n18 - y + 2y = 100\\n3y = 82\\ny = 27.33\\n\\nThis doesn't make sense since y should be a whole number.

Let's simplify the positive solution:\\nx = (19 + sqrt(1045)) / 2\\nx ≈ 8.33\\n\\nThis means that Jack bought 8 brown sharpeners and 10 white sharpeners (since he paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpener).

So, we can try different values of y to find the corresponding value of x.\\nIf y = 6, then x = 17(6) - 82 = 10, which is a valid solution.\\nTherefore, Jack bought 10 brown sharpeners and 8 white sharpeners.\\nThe answer is: {Answer: \\\"A)10,8\\\"}.\\n\", \"llm_task_type\": \"algebraic word problem\"}",

We also know that he paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than brown sharpener. We can use this information to set up two equations and solve for x and y.\n\nLet's start with the equation for the total number of sharpeners:\nx + y = 18\n\nNow let's set up the equation for the total cost:\nx + (x+1)*y = 100\n\nWe can simplify this equation by distributing the y:\nx + xy + y = 100\n\nNow we can use the first equation to solve for x in terms of y:\nx = 18 - y\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n(18 - y) + y(1 + 1) = 100\n18 - y + 2y = 100\n3y = 82\ny = 27.33\n\nThis doesn't make sense since y should be a whole number. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nWe made a mistake in the second equation. It should be:\nx + (x+1)*(18-x) = 100\n\nSimplify:\nx + 18x - x^2 + 18 - x = 100\n-x^2 + 19x - 82 = 0\n\nUse the quadratic formula to solve for x:\nx = (19 ± sqrt(19^2 - 4(-1)(-82))) / (2(-1))\nx = (19 ± sqrt(1045)) / 2\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution since x must be less than 18. Let's simplify the positive solution:\nx = (19 + sqrt(1045)) / 2\nx ≈ 8.33\n\nThis means that Jack bought 8 brown sharpeners and 10 white sharpeners (since he paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpener). Therefore, the answer is: {Answer: \"A)10,8\"}.\n",
                "st: StepThought: Let's assume that Jack bought x brown sharpeners and (18-x) white sharpeners.\nAccording to the problem, the cost of x brown sharpeners is rs. y and the cost of (18-x) white sharpeners is rs. (y+1).\nSo, we can write the equation as:\nxy + (18-x)(y+1) = 100\nSimplify and solve for x:\nxy + 18y - xy + 18 - x = 100\n17y + 18 - x = 100\n17y - x = 82\nx = 17y - 82\nSince x represents the number of brown sharpeners, it must be a positive integer less than or equal to 18. So, we can try different values of y to find the corresponding value of x.\nIf y = 6, then x = 17(6) - 82 = 10, which is a valid solution.\nTherefore, Jack bought 10 brown sharpeners and 8 white sharpeners.\nThe answer is: {Answer: \"A)10,8\"}.\n"

                "pt: PlanThought: planning_thought: Let's start by finding the total ratio of the mixture, which is 2+3+5=10. This means that for every 10 pounds of the mixture, there are 2 pounds of rice, 3 pounds of wheat, and 5 pounds of corn. We know that a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, which is 2/10 of the total mixture. Therefore, we can set up a proportion:\n\n2/10 = 3/x\n\nwhere x is the amount of corn in the bag. Solving for x, we get:\n\nx = 3*10/2*5 = 6\n\nTherefore, the bag of mixture contains 6 pounds of corn.\n\nAnswer: {Answer: D)6}.\n",
                "st: StepThought: Since the ratio of rice to wheat to corn is 2:3:5, we can assume that the bag of mixture contains 2x pounds of rice, 3x pounds of wheat, and 5x pounds of corn, for some positive integer x. \n\nWe are given that the bag contains 3 pounds of rice, so we can set up the following proportion: \n\n2x/3 = 3 \n\nSolving for x, we get x = 4.5. \n\nTherefore, the bag contains 5x = 5(4.5) = 22.5 pounds of corn. \n\nThe correct answer is: {Answer: C)7}.\n"

To do this, we can take the derivative of the expression with respect to x and set it equal to zero:\nd/dx [2(x^2 + 240 - 5x)/x] = 2(3x - 240)/x^2 = 0\nSolving for x, we get x = 80.\nSubstituting this back into the perimeter equation, we get:\n2(80 + y - 5) = 160 + 2y - 10 = 2y + 150\nSo, the length of fencing needed is 2y + 150.\nSubstituting y = 240/x = 3, we get:\n2y + 150 = 156\nTherefore, Alice needs 156 meters of fencing.\nThe answer is {Answer: \"A)58\"}.\n"

We can create two equations using the given information and solve for the speed of the elevator.\n\nAnswer: \n\nLet's assume the total number of steps in the staircase elevator is 'x'. \n\nUsing the first condition, we get: \ndistance = 20 steps\ntime = 10 minutes\nspeed = distance/time = 20/10 = 2 steps/minute\n\nUsing the second condition, we get: \ndistance = x steps\ntime = 20 minutes\nspeed = distance/time = x/20 steps/minute\n\nSince the distance covered in both cases is the same, we can equate the two speeds: \n2 = x/20\nx = 40\n\nTherefore, the total number of steps in the staircase elevator is 40. \n\nUsing the second condition again, we get: \ndistance = 40 steps\ntime = 20 minutes\nspeed = distance/time = 40/20 = 2 steps/minute\n\nHence, the speed of the elevator is 2 steps/minute. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: {Answer: B)2 step/minute}.\n",
                "st: StepThought: Let's assume the total number of steps in the staircase elevator is x. \nIf you walk 20 steps and stop, it takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom. This means that you cover (x-20) steps in 10 minutes. \nSo, your speed is (x-20)/10 steps per minute. \nSimilarly, if you walk 10 steps and stop, it takes 20 minutes to reach the ground. This means that you cover (x-10) steps in 20 minutes. \nSo, your speed is (x-10)/20 steps per minute. \nSince both speeds are the same (as you are walking at the same speed), we can equate them: \n(x-20)/10 = (x-10)/20 \nSolving this equation, we get x = 60. \nSo, the total number of steps in the staircase elevator is 60. \nNow, we can calculate the speed of the elevator: \nIf you walk 20 steps and stop, you cover 40 steps in 20 minutes. So, the elevator covers 20 steps in 20 minutes, which means its speed is 1 step per minute. \nTherefore, the answer is: {\"Answer\": \"A)1 step/minute\"}.\n"

            "explanation": "Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.\n=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.\n=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)\n=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x\n=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x\n=> y = 315 - (9/7)x\n=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,\nx = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153\nx = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144\nx = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135\nx = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126\nAs we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs.

We know that:\n\n- 24% of all students are members of both clubs, so S + C - 24% represents the percentage of students who are members of only one club (or neither).\n- 20% of swim team members are not in the chess club, so the percentage of students who are in both clubs is 80% of the percentage of students who are in the swim team: 0.8S.\n\nPutting these together, we can write an equation:\n\nS + C - 24% = 0.8S\n\nSolving for C, we get:\n\nC = 0.2S + 24%\n\nWe want to find S, so we need another equation. We know that the total percentage of students who are in at least one club is:\n\nS + C - (S ∩ C) = S + C - 24%\n\nBut we also know that this is equal to 24%, since that's the percentage of students who are in both clubs. So we have:\n\nS + C - 24% = 24%\n\nSubstituting our expression for C, we get:\n\nS + 0.2S = 48%\n\nSolving for S, we get:\n\nS = 40%\n\nTherefore, the answer is: {Answer: C)40%}.\n"

                "st: StepThought: There are two cases to consider: \n\nCase 1: Each book is represented by a single letter. In this case, we need at least 10 different letters to represent all 10 types of books. \n\nCase 2: Each book is represented by a pair of two different letters. In this case, we can choose 2 letters out of a set of n letters in n(n-1)/2 ways. Since we have 10 types of books, we need to solve the equation n(n-1)/2 = 10 for the smallest integer value of n. This simplifies to n^2 - n - 20 = 0, which factors as (n-5)(n+4) = 0. The positive solution is n = 5. Therefore, we need at least 5 letters to represent all 10 types of books using pairs of letters. \n\nComparing the two cases, we see that we need at least 5 letters in total to represent all 10 types of books. Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need is 5. \n\nAnswer: {Answer: C)5}.\n"

We can use this information to find out how many rolls are equivalent to x pita breads. \n\n3 rolls = 5 baguettes\n3 rolls = (5/2) * 2 baguettes\n3 rolls = (5/2) * x pita breads\n6 rolls = 5x pita breads\n\nFinally, we know that 6 pita breads = 2 rolls. We can use this information to find out how many pita breads are equivalent to 6 rolls. \n\n6 pita breads = 2 rolls\n6x/5 pita breads = 6 rolls\nx = 5/5 = 1\n\nTherefore, 2 baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 1 pita bread. \n\nAnswer: {Answer: D)2}.\n",

                "st: StepThought: Let P be the population of Boomtown one year ago. According to the problem, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago, so the population two years from now would be 2P. \n\nIf the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years, then the population one year from now would be P + 0.1P = 1.1P, and the population two years from now would be 1.1P + 0.1(1.1P) = 1.21P. \n\nThe percent population increase over the last year would be (1.21P - 1.1P)/1.1P = 0.1P/1.1P = 0.091 = 9.1%. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: {\"Answer\": \"9%.\"}.\n"

                "st: StepThought: According to the given information, we can write the equation:\n\nx*x*x = k, where k is a constant representing the amount of work done.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days. Let's substitute the values in the equation:\n\ny*y*y = k\n\nSolving for k, we get:\n\nk = x*x*x = y*y*y\n\nNow, we can find out how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days:\n\ny*y*y = k = x*x*x\n\ny*y*y = x*x*x\n\ny^3 = x^3\n\ny/x = 1\n\nTherefore, the amount of work that can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days is the same as the amount of work that can be completed by x men working x hours per day in x days. So, the answer is:\n\n{Answer: E) None of these}\n"

We need to find the distance between A and B, so we can use the formula twice, once for each leg of the trip. We also need to use the fact that Kevin was 70 miles away from B, 3 hours before the end of his trip.\\n\\nLet's start with the first leg of the trip, from A to B. We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph, so we can use the formula distance = speed x time to find the distance he covered in this leg. Let's call this distance d1.\\n\\nd1 = 70 x t1\\n\\nNow let's move on to the second leg of the trip, from B back to A. We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 90 mph, so we can use the same formula to find the distance he covered in this leg. Let's call this distance d2.\\n\\nd2 = 90 x t2\\n\\nWe also know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was still approaching B and was only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already covered d1 + d2 - 70 miles of the total distance between A and B. We can use this information to set up an equation:\\n\\nd1 + d2 - 70 = total distance\\n\\nNow we can substitute the expressions we found for d1 and d2 into this equation:\\n\\n70t1 + 90t2 - 70 = total distance\\n\\nWe also know that Kevin's total trip took a certain amount of time, which we can call t. We can use this information to set up another equation:\\n\\nt = t1 + t2 + 3\\n\\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (total distance and t2), which we can solve using algebra. First, let's solve for t1 in terms of t2 using the second equation:\\n\\nt1 = t - t2 - 3\\n\\nNow we can substitute this expression for t1 into the first equation:\\n\\n70(t - t2 - 3) + 90t2 - 70 = total distance\\n\\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\\n\\n20t2 - 70 = total distance\\n\\nFinally, we can use the fact that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph for the first leg of the trip to set up one more equation:\\n\\nd1 = 70(t - t2 - 3) = total distance - d2\\n\\nSubstituting the expression we found for total distance in terms of t2 into this equation, we get:\\n\\n70(t - t2 - 3) = 20t2 - 70 - d2\\n\\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\\n\\n70t - 70t2 - 210 = 20t2 - 70 - d2\\n\\n90t2 + d2 = 70t - 140\\n\\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (total distance and t2), which we can solve using algebra. First, let's solve for d2 in terms of t2 using the second equation:\\n\\nd2 = 70t - 90t2 - 140\\n\\nNow we can substitute this expression for d2 into the first equation:\\n\\n20t2 - 70 = total distance\\n\\nSubstituting the expression we found for total distance in terms of t2 into this equation, we get:\\n\\n20t2 - 70 = 70t - 90t2 - 140\\n\\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\\n\\n110t2 = 210\\n\\nt2 = 1.909\\n\\nNow we can use this value of t2 to find the total distance:\\n\\ntotal distance = 20t2 - 70 = 20(1.909) - 70 = -30.82\\n\\nThis doesn't make sense, since distance can't be negative. We made a mistake somewhere in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.\\n\\nAfter reviewing our calculations, we realized that we made a mistake in the equation d1 + d2 - 70 = total distance. We should have subtracted d2 from the total distance, since d2 is the distance Kevin covered on the second leg of the trip, from B back to A. This means that the correct equation is:\\n\\nd1 + total distance - d2 - 70 = total distance\\n\\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\\n\\nd1 - d2 - 70 = 0\\n\\nNow we can substitute the expressions we found for d1 and d2 into this equation:\\n\\n70t1 - 90t2 - 70 = 0\\n\\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\\n\\n7t1 - 9t2 - 7 = 0\\n\\nNow we can use the fact that Kevin's total trip took a certain amount of time, which we can call t, to set up another equation:\\n\\nt = t1 + t2 + 3\\n\\nSubstituting the expression we found for t1 in terms of t2 into this equation, we get:\\n\\nt = 10t2/3 + t2 + 3\\n\\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\\n\\nt = 13t2/3 + 3\\n\\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (total distance and t2), which we can solve using algebra. First, let's solve for t2 in terms of t using the second equation:\\n\\nt2 = 3(t - 3)/10\\n\\nNow we can substitute this expression for t2 into the first equation:\\n\\n7t1 - 9(3(t - 3)/10) - 7 = 0\\n\\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\\n\\n7t1 - 27t/10 + 24 = 0\\n\\nNow we can use the fact that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph for the first leg of the trip to set up one more equation:\\n\\nd1 = 70t1\\n\\nSubstituting the expression we found for t1 in terms of t2 into this equation, we get:\\n\\nd1 = 70(10t2/3 - t2/10 - 9/10)\\n\\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\\n\\nd1 = 140t2/3 - 7t2/10 - 63/10\\n\\nNow we have three equations with two unknowns (total distance and t), which we can solve using algebra.

This means that he covered the remaining distance of 70 miles in 3 hours.\n\nSo, 70 = 70 x (t2 - t1 - 3)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nt2 - t1 = 4\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of t2 - t1 in the above equations to get:\n\nd = 70 x t1 = 90 x t2\n\nd = 70 x t1 = 90 x (t1 + 4)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n7t1 = 9t1 + 36\n\n2t1 = 36\n\nt1 = 18\n\nSo, d = 70 x 18 = 1260 miles\n\nTherefore, the distance between A and B is 1260 miles.\n\nThe answer is: {Answer: D)360}.\n",
                "pt: PlanThought: planning_thought: Let's use the formula distance = speed x time to solve this problem. We need to find the distance between A and B, so we can use the formula twice, once for each leg of the trip. We also need to use the fact that Kevin was 70 miles away from B, 3 hours before the end of his trip.\n\nLet's start with the first leg of the trip, from A to B. We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph, so we can use the formula distance = speed x time to find the distance he covered in this leg. Let's call this distance d1.\n\nd1 = 70 x t1\n\nNow let's move on to the second leg of the trip, from B back to A. We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 90 mph, so we can use the same formula to find the distance he covered in this leg. Let's call this distance d2.\n\nd2 = 90 x t2\n\nWe also know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was still approaching B and was only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already covered d1 + d2 - 70 miles of the total distance between A and B. We can use this information to set up an equation:\n\nd1 + d2 - 70 = total distance\n\nNow we can substitute the expressions we found for d1 and d2 into this equation:\n\n70t1 + 90t2 - 70 = total distance\n\nWe also know that Kevin's total trip took a certain amount of time, which we can call t. We can use this information to set up another equation:\n\nt = t1 + t2 + 3\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (total distance and t2), which we can solve using algebra. First, let's solve for t1 in terms of t2 using the second equation:\n\nt1 = t - t2 - 3\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for t1 into the first equation:\n\n70(t - t2 - 3) + 90t2 - 70 = total distance\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n20t2 - 70 = total distance\n\nFinally, we can use the fact that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph for the first leg of the trip to set up one more equation:\n\nd1 = 70(t - t2 - 3) = total distance - d2\n\nSubstituting the expression we found for total distance in terms of t2 into this equation, we get:\n\n70(t - t2 - 3) = 20t2 - 70 - d2\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n70t - 70t2 - 210 = 20t2 - 70 - d2\n\n90t2 + d2 = 70t - 140\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (total distance and t2), which we can solve using algebra. First, let's solve for d2 in terms of t2 using the second equation:\n\nd2 = 70t - 90t2 - 140\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for d2 into the first equation:\n\n20t2 - 70 = total distance\n\nSubstituting the expression we found for total distance in terms of t2 into this equation, we get:\n\n20t2 - 70 = 70t - 90t2 - 140\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n110t2 = 210\n\nt2 = 1.909\n\nNow we can use this value of t2 to find the total distance:\n\ntotal distance = 20t2 - 70 = 20(1.909) - 70 = -30.82\n\nThis doesn't make sense, since distance can't be negative. We made a mistake somewhere in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nAfter reviewing our calculations, we realized that we made a mistake in the equation d1 + d2 - 70 = total distance. We should have subtracted d2 from the total distance, since d2 is the distance Kevin covered on the second leg of the trip, from B back to A. This means that the correct equation is:\n\nd1 + total distance - d2 - 70 = total distance\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nd1 - d2 - 70 = 0\n\nNow we can substitute the expressions we found for d1 and d2 into this equation:\n\n70t1 - 90t2 - 70 = 0\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n7t1 - 9t2 - 7 = 0\n\nNow we can use the fact that Kevin's total trip took a certain amount of time, which we can call t, to set up another equation:\n\nt = t1 + t2 + 3\n\nSubstituting the expression we found for t1 in terms of t2 into this equation, we get:\n\nt = 10t2/3 + t2 + 3\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nt = 13t2/3 + 3\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (total distance and t2), which we can solve using algebra. First, let's solve for t2 in terms of t using the second equation:\n\nt2 = 3(t - 3)/10\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for t2 into the first equation:\n\n7t1 - 9(3(t - 3)/10) - 7 = 0\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n7t1 - 27t/10 + 24 = 0\n\nNow we can use the fact that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph for the first leg of the trip to set up one more equation:\n\nd1 = 70t1\n\nSubstituting the expression we found for t1 in terms of t2 into this equation, we get:\n\nd1 = 70(10t2/3 - t2/10 - 9/10)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nd1 = 140t2/3 - 7t2/10 - 63/10\n\nNow we have three equations with two unknowns (total distance and t), which we can solve using algebra. First, let's solve for t in terms of t2 using the second equation:\n\nt = 10t2/3 + 3\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for t into the first equation:\n\n7t1 - 27(10t2/3 + 3)/10 + 24 = 0\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n7t1 - 9t2 - 3 = 0\n\nNow we can substitute the expressions we found for t1 and t2 into this equation:\n\n7(10t2/3 - t2/10 - 9/10) - 9t2 - 3 = 0\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n67t2/3 - 63/10 = 0\n\nt2 = 0.939\n\nNow we can use this value of t2 to find the total distance:\n\ntotal distance = d1 + d2 = 70t1 + 90t2 = 70(10t2/3 - t2/10 - 9/10) + 90t2 = 270\n\nTherefore, the answer is: {\"Answer\": \"C)270\"}.\n",

So, if we have 6x grams of alloy X, we have 2x grams of zinc and 3x grams of copper.\n\nSimilarly, for alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which can be simplified to 2:3. This means that for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts of copper. So, if we have 11y grams of alloy Y, we have 2y grams of zinc and 3y grams of copper.\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z by adding the amounts from alloy X and Y. We have 40 grams of alloy X, which means we have 2/5 * 40 = 16 grams of zinc and 3/5 * 40 = 24 grams of copper. We also have 60 grams of alloy Y, which means we have 2/18 * 60 = 20/3 grams of zinc and 3/18 * 60 = 10 grams of copper.\n\nAdding these amounts, we get a total of 16 + 20/3 = 68/3 grams of zinc and 24 + 10 = 34 grams of copper in alloy Z.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 68/3 : 34, which can be simplified to 20:3.\n\nThe answer is: {Answer: C)59:90}.\n"

We know that V + W + VW = 250. We also know that W = 2.5VW. \\n\\nIf 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, then the number of files infected by a virus is 0.5(250) = 125. Therefore, the number of files not infected by a virus is 250 - 125 = 125. \\n\\nWe can now use the information about W and VW to find the number of files infected by a worm. Since W = 2.5VW, we know that VW = W/2.5. Therefore, the total number of files infected by a worm is W + VW = 3.5VW. \\n\\nWe can set up an equation using the information we have: V + W + VW = 250. Substituting W = 2.5VW and VW = W/2.5, we get V + 2.5VW + W/2.5 = 250. Simplifying, we get 3.5VW = 250 - V - W. \\n\\nWe know that the number of files not infected by a worm is 125, so the number of files infected by a worm is 250 - 125 = 125. Therefore, we can substitute W = 125 - VW into the equation we just derived: 3.5VW = 250 - V - (125 - VW). Simplifying, we get 4.5VW + V = 125. \\n\\nWe can solve for VW in terms of V: VW = (125 - V)/4.5. We know that W + VW = 125, so we can substitute W = 125 - VW to get W = 125 - (125 - V)/4.5 = (4.5*125 - 125 + V)/4.5 = (3.5*125 - V)/4.5. \\n\\nWe want to find the number of files not infected by a worm, which is V + VW. Substituting VW = (125 - V)/4.5, we get V + VW = V + (125 - V)/4.5 = (4.5V + 125 - V)/4.5 = (3.5V + 125)/4.5. \\n\\nWe want this expression to equal one of the answer choices.

Substituting into our equations, we get W = 87.5 and VW = 22.5. Therefore, the number of files not infected by a worm is V + VW = 10 + 22.5 = 32.5, which is not equal to 70. \\n\\nTrying C)75: (3.5V + 125)/4.5 = 75. Solving for V, we get V = 15. Substituting into our equations, we get W = 75 and VW = 30. Therefore, the number of files not infected by a worm is V + VW = 15 + 30 = 45, which is not equal to 75. \\n\\nTrying D)100: (3.5V + 125)/4.5 = 100. Solving for V, we get V = 40. Substituting into our equations, we get W = 37.5 and VW = 12.5. Therefore, the number of files not infected by a worm is V + VW = 40 + 12.5 = 52.5, which is not equal to 100. \\n\\nTrying E)125: (3.5V + 125)/4.5 = 125. Solving for V, we get V = 65. Substituting into our equations, we get W = 0 and VW = 62.5. Therefore, the number of files not infected by a worm is V + VW = 65 + 62.5 = 127.5, which is not equal to 125. \\n\\nTherefore, none of the answer choices work.
