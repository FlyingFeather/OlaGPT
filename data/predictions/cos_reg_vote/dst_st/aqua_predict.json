            "explanation": "Explanation :\nLet the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/√3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)\nh / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)\nSo, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\nAnswer : A",

                "st: StepThought: First, let's assume that Jack bought x brown sharpeners and y white sharpeners. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n\nx + y = 18 (because he bought a total of 18 sharpeners)\nand\nx(y+1) + y = 100 (because he paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpener)\n\nNow we can use algebra to solve for x and y. \n\nExpanding the second equation, we get:\n\nxy + x + y = 99\n\nRearranging the first equation to solve for x, we get:\n\nx = 18 - y\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n(18-y)(y+1) + (y) = 100\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\ny^2 + 17y - 81 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\ny = (-17 ± sqrt(17^2 - 4(-81)))/2\ny = (-17 ± sqrt(865))/2\n\nSince we know that y has to be a whole number, we can round these values to the nearest integer:\n\ny ≈ 10 or y ≈ -8\n\nSince y represents the number of white sharpeners, we can eliminate the negative solution and conclude that Jack bought 10 white sharpeners. \n\nTo find the number of brown sharpeners, we can substitute y=10 into the first equation:\n\nx + 10 = 18\n\nx = 8\n\nTherefore, Jack bought 8 brown sharpeners. \n\nThe answer is: {Answer: A} (10,8)\n"

(i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)\nAs a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers.

If we assume that half of the types of books can be represented by a single letter and the other half by a pair of letters, we would need:\n\n5 + 163/2 = 87.5\n\nSince we cannot have a fractional number of letters, we need to round up to the nearest integer, which is 88. Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books is 88.\n\nAnswer: {Answer: C}\n",
                "st: StepThought: First, we need to determine the number of ways to represent a single book using a single letter or a pair of letters. For a single letter, there are 26 options (assuming we use the English alphabet). For a pair of letters, there are 26 options for the first letter and 25 options for the second letter (since we cannot repeat the first letter). Therefore, there are 26 + (26*25) = 676 possible codes for a single book.\n\nNext, we need to determine the minimum number of letters needed to represent all 10 types of books. We can use a simple combinatorics formula to determine the total number of possible codes using n letters: n + n^2. We want this total to be greater than or equal to 10*676 (since we need at least 676 codes for each book type). \n\nWe can start by trying n=3: 3 + 3^2 = 12, which is greater than 10*676. Therefore, the answer is A)3.\n\n{Answer: A}\n"

Let's use the equation for the plane: \n\ndistance traveled by plane = (10s)t = 10s(18/s) = 180 miles \n\nTherefore, the distance from the starting point when they meet is 180 miles. \n\nAnswer: {Answer: C}\n"

Check the answer by plugging in the values into the original equations:\n- S + 30 = 2(A - 30) -> 62 + 30 = 2(146 - 30) -> 92 = 2(116)\n- A + 10 = 3(S - 10) -> 146 + 10 = 3(62 - 10) -> 156 = 3(52)\n\n{Answer: B}\n",

Let A be the amount of money Arjun has and let S be the amount of money Sajal has.\n\nStep 2: From the problem, we know that if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. This can be written as:\n\nS + 30 = 2(A - 30)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nS + 30 = 2A - 60\n\nS = 2A - 90\n\nStep 3: Similarly, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. This can be written as:\n\nA + 10 = 3(S - 10)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nA + 10 = 3S - 30\n\nA = 3S - 40\n\nStep 4: Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for A and S by substituting one equation into the other. Let's substitute the expression for S from Step 2 into the equation from Step 3:\n\nA + 10 = 3(2A - 90) - 30\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nA + 10 = 6A - 300\n\n5A = 310\n\nA = 62\n\nStep 5: Now that we know A, we can substitute it back into either equation to find S. Let's use the equation from Step 2:\n\nS = 2A - 90\n\nS = 2(62) - 90\n\nS = 34\n\nTherefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.\n\nAnswer: {Answer: C}\n"

Let the total bill for the month be represented by 'b'.\n\nStep 2: Write down the given information as equations:\nFrom the first month, we know that:\nf + 540c = 1800\n\nFrom the second month, we know that:\nf + 620c = 2040\n\nStep 3: Solve for 'f' and 'c':\nWe can solve for 'f' by subtracting the second equation from the first equation:\n(540c - 620c) = 1800 - 2040\n-80c = -240\nc = 3\n\nNow we can substitute the value of 'c' into either of the equations to solve for 'f':\nf + 540(3) = 1800\nf = 990\n\nTherefore, the equation for the bill is:\nb = 990 + 3n\n\nStep 4: Use the equation to find the bill for the third month:\nIn the third month, 500 calls were made. Therefore:\nb = 990 + 3(500)\nb = 2490\n\nThe bill for the third month would be Rs.2490.\n\nAnswer: {Answer: D}\n"

            "explanation": "If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.\nThe two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence\nT = 13 X = 7 Y\nHence 13 X = 7 Y\nSolve the above for X\nX = 7 Y / 13\nWe want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence\nX = 7 (13) / 13 = 7\nTime T is given by\nT = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes\ncorrect answer A",

Subtract the area of the semi circles from the area of the paper to find the remaining area.\\n\\n1. The paper is in a square form with one side measuring 20 cm.\\n2. The area of the paper is calculated by multiplying the length and width: 20 cm x 20 cm = 400 cm².\\n3. The diameter of the semi circles is equal to the length of the square's side, which is 20 cm. The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where r is the radius. Since the diameter is given, we need to divide it by 2 to get the radius. Therefore, the radius is 10 cm. The area of one semi circle is A = 1/2πr² = 1/2π(10 cm)² = 50π/2 cm² = 25π cm². The area of two semi circles is 50π cm².\\n4. To find the remaining area, we need to subtract the area of the semi circles from the area of the paper: 400 cm² - 50π cm² ≈ 8.79 cm².\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is {Answer: B}.\\n#st: StepThought: First, we need to find the area of the square paper, which is (20 cm)^2 = 400 cm^2. \\n\\nNext, we need to find the area of the two semi circles. The radius of each semi circle is half of the side of the square, which is 10 cm. The formula for the area of a semi circle is (πr^2)/2. So, the area of one semi circle is (π(10 cm)^2)/2 = 50π/2 = 25π cm^2. The area of two semi circles is 50π cm^2. \\n\\nWhen we cut down the two semi circles, we are left with a shape that looks like a rectangle with two semicircles on the ends.

                "dst: DecompositionThought: Disassembled thought:\n1. Identify the shape of the paper and the dimensions given.\n2. Determine the area of the paper before the semi circles are cut.\n3. Calculate the area of the two semi circles.\n4. Subtract the area of the semi circles from the area of the paper to find the remaining area.\n\n1. The paper is in a square form with one side measuring 20 cm.\n2. The area of the paper is calculated by multiplying the length and width: 20 cm x 20 cm = 400 cm².\n3. The diameter of the semi circles is equal to the length of the square's side, which is 20 cm. The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where r is the radius. Since the diameter is given, we need to divide it by 2 to get the radius. Therefore, the radius is 10 cm. The area of one semi circle is A = 1/2πr² = 1/2π(10 cm)² = 50π/2 cm² = 25π cm². The area of two semi circles is 50π cm².\n4. To find the remaining area, we need to subtract the area of the semi circles from the area of the paper: 400 cm² - 50π cm² ≈ 8.79 cm².\n\nTherefore, the answer is {Answer: B}.\n",
                "st: StepThought: First, we need to find the area of the square paper, which is (20 cm)^2 = 400 cm^2. \n\nNext, we need to find the area of the two semi circles. The radius of each semi circle is half of the side of the square, which is 10 cm. The formula for the area of a semi circle is (πr^2)/2. So, the area of one semi circle is (π(10 cm)^2)/2 = 50π/2 = 25π cm^2. The area of two semi circles is 50π cm^2. \n\nWhen we cut down the two semi circles, we are left with a shape that looks like a rectangle with two semicircles on the ends. The length of the rectangle is the same as the side of the square, which is 20 cm. The width of the rectangle is the diameter of the semi circle, which is 10 cm. So, the area of the rectangle is 20 cm x 10 cm = 200 cm^2. \n\nThe area of the two semicircles is 50π cm^2, and the area of the rectangle is 200 cm^2. To find the area of the remaining paper, we need to subtract the area of the semicircles and the rectangle from the area of the square paper. \n\nArea of remaining paper = 400 cm^2 - 50π cm^2 - 200 cm^2 \n\nArea of remaining paper = 400 cm^2 - 250π/2 cm^2 - 200 cm^2 \n\nArea of remaining paper = 400 cm^2 - 125π cm^2 \n\nArea of remaining paper ≈ 8.71 cm^2 \n\nTherefore, the answer is {Answer: D}.\n"

Let's call the distance between A and B \\\"d\\\". \\n\\n   The time it took Kevin to travel from A to B is: \\n   t1 = d/70\\n\\n   The time it took Kevin to travel from B to A is:\\n   t2 = d/90\\n\\n   The total time of Kevin's trip is:\\n   t_total = t1 + t2\\n\\n   We also know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.

                "dst: DecompositionThought: To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps:\n\n1. Determine the total time of Kevin's trip.\n2. Use the time and speed information to find the distance between A and B.\n3. Check which option matches the distance we found.\n\nUsing this approach, we can solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Let's call the distance between A and B \"d\". \n\n   The time it took Kevin to travel from A to B is: \n   t1 = d/70\n\n   The time it took Kevin to travel from B to A is:\n   t2 = d/90\n\n   The total time of Kevin's trip is:\n   t_total = t1 + t2\n\n   We also know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that Kevin had already spent (t_total - 3) hours on his trip.\n\n2. We can use the time and speed information to find the distance between A and B. \n\n   The distance Kevin traveled from A to B is:\n   d = 70 * t1\n\n   The distance Kevin traveled from B to A is:\n   d = 90 * t2\n\n   Adding these two distances together, we get:\n   2d = 70 * t1 + 90 * t2\n\n   We can substitute t1 and t2 with expressions in terms of d:\n   t1 = d/70\n   t2 = d/90\n\n   2d = 70 * (d/70) + 90 * (d/90)\n   2d = d + d\n   2d = 2d\n\n   This equation is true, which means that our calculations are correct. Therefore, the distance between A and B is:\n   d = 2 * 70 * 90 / (70 + 90) = 252\n\n3. The distance we found matches option C, so the answer is:\n   {Answer: C}\n",

So, the time it took him to reach B is:\n\ntime = distance / speed\ntime = d / 70\n\nStep 2: Find the time it took Kevin to return from point B to A.\nWe know that distance = speed x time. Let's call the distance from B to A \"x\". Kevin's speed is 90 mph. So, the time it took him to return to A is:\n\ntime = distance / speed\ntime = x / 90\n\nStep 3: Find the total time of Kevin's trip.\nWe know that Kevin had exactly 3 hours left before the end of his trip when he was 70 miles away from B. This means that he had already spent some time driving from A to B, and some time driving from B to the point where he was 70 miles away from B. Let's call the time he spent driving from A to B \"t1\", and the time he spent driving from B to the point where he was 70 miles away from B \"t2\". We can write:\n\nt1 + t2 + 3 = total time\n\nStep 4: Use the information we have to solve for \"d\".\nWe know that:\n\nt1 = d / 70 (from Step 1)\nt2 = (d - 70) / 90 (because he was 70 miles away from B when he had 3 hours left, so he had already driven d - 70 miles from B to A) (from Step 2)\n\nSubstituting these values into Step 3, we get:\n\nd / 70 + (d - 70) / 90 + 3 = total time\n\nWe don't know what the total time is, but we can simplify the equation by multiplying everything by the least common multiple of the denominators (630):\n\n9d + 7(d - 70) + 1890 = 630 * total time\n16d - 490 = 630 * total time\n\nWe also know that the total time is the sum of t1, t2, and 3:\n\ntotal time = d / 70 + (d - 70) / 90 + 3\n\nWe can substitute this into the equation above to get:\n\n16d - 490 = 630 * (d / 70 + (d - 70) / 90 + 3)\n16d - 490 = 9d + 7(d - 70) + 1890\n16d - 490 = 16d - 490 + 1260\n0 = 1260\n\nThis is a contradiction, so there is no solution.

So, we can write:\n\nd = SM x (4 - 0.5) = SN x 3.5\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nSM = (7/6)SN\n\nNow, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\nLet's find the time taken by Train M to cover the distance d:\n\ntime taken by Train M = d / SM\n\nSimilarly, let's find the time taken by Train N to cover the distance d:\n\ntime taken by Train N = d / SN\n\nWhen the two trains meet, their total time taken would be:\n\ntime taken by Train M + time taken by Train N = 4 + 3.5 = 7.5 hours\n\nSubstituting the above equations, we get:\n\nd / SM + d / SN = 7.5\n\nSubstituting SM = (7/6)SN, we get:\n\nd / (7/6)SN + d / SN = 7.5\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nd = 15SN / 13\n\nNow, we can find the time taken by Train M to cover the distance d:\n\ntime taken by Train M = d / SM = (15SN / 13) / ((7/6)SN) = 10.8 hours\n\nTherefore, the two trains cross each other 10.8 hours after Train M leaves City A, which is at 3:48 pm.\n\nAnswer: {Answer: None of the above}\n\n"

Let the time taken for Allen to reach Y be t1 hours.\n   c. Let the time taken for Bob to reach X be t2 hours.\n   d. Let the time taken for Allen to return to X be t3 hours.\n   e. Let the time taken for Bob to return to Y be t4 hours.\n   f. Distance covered by Allen in t1 hours = 54t1 km\n   g. Distance covered by Bob in t2 hours = 78t2 km\n   h. Distance covered by Allen in t3 hours = 54t3 km\n   i. Distance covered by Bob in t4 hours = 78t4 km\n   j. Total distance covered by Bob = 78t2 + 78t4 km\n   k. Total distance covered by Allen = 54t1 + 54t3 km\n   l. Total time taken for them to meet for the second time = t1 + t2 + t3 + t4 hours\n   m. Distance covered by Bob when they meet for the second time = 78(t2 + t4) km\n   n. Distance covered by Allen when they meet for the second time = 54(t1 + t3) km\n   o. According to the problem, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen when they meet for the second time. Therefore, we have:\n         78(t2 + t4) = 54(t1 + t3) + 48\n   p. Also, we know that:\n         t1 + t3 = t2 + t4\n   q. Solving the above two equations, we get:\n         t1 + t3 = 4t2 + 4t4 - 4\n   r. Substituting this value in equation (o), we get:\n         78t2 + 78t4 - 72 = 54t1 + 54t3 + 48\n   s. Simplifying the above equation, we get:\n         39t2 + 39t4 - 36 = 27t1 + 27t3 + 24\n   t.

We also know that:\n         Distance covered by Allen when they meet for the second time = Distance covered by Bob when they meet for the second time - 48 km\n   v. Substituting the values of distances and times in the above equation, we get:\n         54(t1 + t3) = 78(t2 + t4) - 48\n   w. Simplifying the above equation, we get:\n         27t1 + 27t3 = 39t2 + 39t4 - 24\n   x. Dividing both sides by 3, we get:\n         9t1 + 9t3 = 13t2 + 13t4 - 8\n   y.

He needs to borrow $20 000 = $800 = $19 200. He would borrow this money on day 30 and repay it on day 100 (the day the original invoice is due) resulting in a 70-day loan. The interest he should be willing to pay on borrowed money should not exceed the cash discount $800.\nr=I/pt=21.73%\nThe highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 21.73%.

This means that the profit per pen is:\n\nprofit per pen = 0.25 * Rs. 10 = Rs. 2.5\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total profit on non-defective pens\nThe total profit on non-defective pens is simply the number of non-defective pens multiplied by the profit per pen:\n\ntotal profit on non-defective pens = 0.9x * Rs. 2.5 = Rs. 2.25x\n\nStep 6: Calculate the total cost of non-defective pens\nThe total cost of non-defective pens is simply the total revenue (7200 pens at Rs. 10 each) minus the total profit on non-defective pens:\n\ntotal cost of non-defective pens = (7200 * Rs. 10) - (Rs. 2.25x) = Rs. 45,000 - Rs. 2.25x\n\nStep 7: Calculate the cost per non-defective pen\nThe cost per non-defective pen is simply the total cost of non-defective pens divided by the number of non-defective pens:\n\ncost per non-defective pen = (Rs. 45,000 - Rs. 2.25x) / 0.9x = Rs. 50 - Rs. 2.5 = Rs. 47.5\n\nStep 8: Choose the correct answer\nThe question asks for the manufactured cost of each pen, which includes both the cost of non-defective pens and the cost of defective pens. Since we know that the cost per non-defective pen is Rs. 47.5, we can calculate the manufactured cost of each pen as:\n\nmanufactured cost per pen = (Rs. 47.5 * x) / (0.9x) = Rs. 52.78\n\nTherefore, the answer is E) None of these.\n\n{Answer: E}\n"

If we observe, the prices are not random and there seems to be a pattern. The price of a pineapple is 1.5 times the price of an orange (18 x 1.5 = 27). Similarly, the price of a grape is 0.83 times the price of an orange (18 x 0.83 = 15). Applying the same logic, we can find the price of a mango. The price of a mango should be 1.11 times the price of an orange (18 x 1.11 = 19.98). Rounding off to the nearest dollar, the price of a mango is 20 dollars, which matches option C.\n",

Let's call this number \\\"x\\\". \\n\\nWe know that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. So, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5x. \\n\\nWe also know that all 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So, we can set up an equation: \\n\\nx + 2.5x + y = 250 \\n\\nwhere \\\"y\\\" is the number of files infected only by a virus. \\n\\nWe also know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus.

So, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5x. \n\nWe also know that all 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both.

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr^2h, where r is the radius (half the diameter) and h is the height (thickness). \n\nr = 15/2 = 7.5 mm\nh = 2 mm\nV = π(7.5)^2(2) = 352.5 mm^3\n\nSince the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, we can divide the volume by 2 to get the volume of each metal. \n\nVolume of aluminum = 352.5/2 = 176.25 mm^3\n\nNext, we need to find the weight of the aluminum in the alloy coin. We know that the weight of the coin is 30 grams, so we can subtract the weight of the silver to get the weight of the aluminum. \n\nLet x be the weight of the silver. \nx + (30 - x) = 30\nx = 15\n\nSo the weight of the silver is 15 grams. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of the aluminum in the alloy coin is 30 - 15/2 = 22.5 grams. \n\nNow we can use the density of aluminum to find the volume of the pure aluminum coin. The density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm^3. \n\nDensity = mass/volume\nVolume = mass/density = 22.5/2.7 = 8.33 cm^3\n\nFinally, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder again to find the height of the pure aluminum coin. \n\nr = 15/2 = 7.5 mm\nV = 8.33 cm^3 = πr^2h\nh = V/πr^2 = 8.33/(π(7.5)^2) = 0.047 mm\n\nThe height of the pure aluminum coin is 0.047 mm. \n\nNow we can use the density of aluminum again to find the weight of the pure aluminum coin. \n\nDensity = mass/volume\nMass = density x volume = 2.7 x 0.047 = 0.127 grams\n\nTherefore, the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum is 0.127 grams. \n\n{Answer: A}\n"

After the third feeding session, there will be 2/3 of 4/9 (or 8/27) of the original dog food left in the bowl. After the fourth feeding session (at noon), there will be 2/3 of 8/27 (or 16/81) of the original dog food left in the bowl.\n3. We have calculated that there is 16/81 of the original dog food left in the bowl at noon.\n4. To calculate the percentage of the original dog food left in the bowl at noon, we need to divide the amount of dog food left by the original amount of dog food and multiply by 100. So, (16/81)/(1) * 100 = 19.75, which is approximately 20%.\n\nAnswer: {Answer: A}\n",
                "st: StepThought: Step 1: Determine the number of feeding sessions the dog had before noon.\nThe dog started eating at 8:00 am and ate once every hour until noon, which is a total of 4 hours. Therefore, the dog had 4 feeding sessions.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the fraction of food remaining after each feeding session.\nThe dog ate 1/3 of the remaining food at each feeding session. So, after the first feeding session, 2/3 of the original food was left. After the second feeding session, 2/3 of 2/3 or 4/9 of the original food was left. After the third feeding session, 2/3 of 4/9 or 8/27 of the original food was left. After the fourth feeding session, 2/3 of 8/27 or 16/81 of the original food was left.\n\nStep 3: Convert the fraction of food remaining to a percentage.\nTo convert a fraction to a percentage, we multiply it by 100. So, the percentage of food remaining before the dog began to eat at noon is:\n\n16/81 x 100 = 19.75%\n\nStep 4: Round the percentage to the nearest whole number.\nThe question asks for the approximate percentage, so we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number. The nearest whole number to 19.75% is 20%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: {Answer: A}.\n"

This can be done using the combination formula:\n\nC(5,2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = 10\n\nSo there are 10 possible combinations of two horses that Mr. Jain can select.\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse. Since there is only one winning horse out of five, the probability of selecting it on the first try is 1/5. If Mr. Jain doesn't select the winning horse on the first try, there are now only four horses left, one of which is the winning horse. So the probability of selecting the winning horse on the second try is 1/4.\n\nTo find the overall probability of selecting the winning horse, we need to add the probabilities of selecting it on the first try and on the second try:\n\nP(winning horse) = 1/5 + (4/5 * 1/4) = 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5\n\nTherefore, the answer is {Answer: B}.\n"

We can find the factors of 1397 by trial division: \\n\\n1397 ÷ 1 = 1397\\n1397 ÷ 7 = 199\\n1397 ÷ 17 = 82\\n1397 ÷ 19 = 73\\n\\nSo the possible values of N are 1, 7, 17, 19, 73, 199, and 1397. \\n\\nTo find the sum of the digits of N, we need to try each of these values and see which one satisfies the condition. \\n\\nIf N = 1, then the remainder when 2272 is divided by N is 0, which is not the same as the remainder when 875 is divided by N (which is also 0).

To solve for g, we can cross-multiply and simplify:\n\n2(166.67) = 5g\n333.34 = 5g\ng = 66.67\n\nSo there are approximately 66.67 girls in the class.\n\nStep 3: Round to the nearest whole number.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a child, we need to round our answer to the nearest whole number. Since 0.67 is closer to 1 than 0, we round up to 67.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{Answer: E) 70}\n"
