            "explanation": "Explanation :\nLet the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/√3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)\nh / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)\nSo, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\nAnswer : A",

This means that the total number of students is the sum of the three fractions:\n1/16 x + 1/10 x + 1/8 x = (5 + 8 + 10)/80 x = 23/80 x\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of students = 23/80 x\n\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:\n17/80 x - 23/80 x = -6/80 x = -3/40 x\n\nSince x is a 4-digit number, it must be between 1000 and 9999. Let's assume x = 1000 to find the minimum and maximum number of students:\nMinimum number of students = 23/80 x 1000 = 287.5 (rounded up to 288)\nMaximum number of students = 17/80 x 1000 = 212.5 (rounded down to 212)\n\nTherefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:\n288 - 212 = 76\n\nAnswer: {Answer: \"D)7890\"}\n",

Then, we have:\n\nc^2 = b^2 + h^2\n\nSince the two triangles are congruent, they have the same hypotenuse. Therefore, we can write:\n\n2c^2 = (x-4)^2\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nc^2 = [(x-4)^2]/2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nc = (x-4)/sqrt(2)\n\nThe perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x. We need to express this in terms of c. \n\nSince the two triangles are congruent, each triangle has two sides of length c and one side of length x-4. Therefore, the perimeter of each triangle is:\n\nc + c + (x-4) = 2c + x - 4\n\nThe perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is:\n\n4x = 2(2c + x - 4)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n4x = 4c + 2x - 8\n\n2x = 4c - 8\n\nx = 2c - 4\n\nSubstituting this expression for x into the equation for the perimeter, we get:\n\n4x = 2(2c + (2c-4) - 4)\n\n4x = 4c - 8\n\nx = (4c - 8)/4\n\nx = c - 2\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is:\n\n4x = 4(c-2) = 4c - 8\n\nWe know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. Therefore, we have:\n\n(1/2)bh = 70\n\nbh = 140\n\nSubstituting c = (x-4)/sqrt(2) and x = c-2, we get:\n\nb = h = sqrt(280/(c^2-8c+16))\n\nSubstituting this expression for b and h into the equation for the perimeter, we get:\n\n4c - 8 = 8sqrt(280/(c^2-8c+16))\n\nSquaring both sides and simplifying, we get:\n\n16c^4 - 448c^3 + 3136c^2 - 6272c + 3136 = 5120\n\nDividing both sides by 16, we get:\n\nc^4 - 28c^3 + 196c^2 - 392c + 196 = 320\n\nWe can use trial and error or a graphing calculator to solve this equation. We find that c is approximately 9.8 feet. \n\nSubstituting this value of c into the equation for the perimeter, we get:\n\n4c - 8 = 38.4\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{Answer: D)62}\n"

            "explanation": "If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.\nThe two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence\nT = 13 X = 7 Y\nHence 13 X = 7 Y\nSolve the above for X\nX = 7 Y / 13\nWe want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence\nX = 7 (13) / 13 = 7\nTime T is given by\nT = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes\ncorrect answer A",

Area covered by doors and windows = 15 sq.m = 1500 sq.cm.\n5. Area to be covered with paper = Total area - Area covered by doors and windows = 2600 - 1500 = 1100 sq.cm.\n6. Width of the paper = 50 cm = 0.5 m and cost of paper = Rs.2 per meter.\n7. Length of paper required = Area to be covered with paper / Width of paper = 1100 / 50 = 22 m.\n8. Cost of papering the walls = Length of paper required * Cost of paper per meter = 22 * 2 = Rs.44.\n9. But, it is given that cost of papering the walls = Rs.260.\n10. Therefore, cost of painting the walls = Rs.260 - Rs.44 = Rs.216.\n11. Now, using the ratios, we get 2x / 5y = 2 / 7.\n12. Solving the above equation, we get x / y = 5 / 7.\n13.

We can do this by dividing the annual interest rate by 2 since interest is compounded every six months.\n\nSemi-annual interest rate = 12%/2 = 6%\n\nNext, we need to find the number of compounding periods. Since the bond is for 1 year and interest is compounded every six months, there are 2 compounding periods.\n\nNow we can use the formula for compound interest:\n\nCI = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) - P\n\nwhere:\nP = principal amount = $5,000\nr = annual interest rate = 12%\nn = number of times interest is compounded per year = 2\nt = time in years = 1\nCI = compound interest\n\nCI = 5000(1 + 0.06/2)^(2*1) - 5000\nCI = 5000(1.03)^2 - 5000\nCI = 5000(1.0609) - 5000\nCI = $304.50\n\nTherefore, the bond accrued $304.50 in interest at maturity.\n\nAnswer: {Answer: D)$202}\n",
                "turbo: GPT: CI = P{ [ 1 + (r/n) ]n*t - 1 }\nwhere P = principal amount, r = annual interest rate, n = number of times the interest is compounded per year, t = time in years\n\nIn this case, P = $5,000, r = 12%, n = 2 (compounded every six months), and t = 1 year.\n\nCI = $5,000{ [ 1 + (0.12/2) ]2*1 - 1 }\n= $5,000{ [ 1 + 0.06 ]2 - 1 }\n= $5,000{ 1.1236 - 1 }\n= $5,000{ 0.1236 }\n= $618\n\nAnswer: B) $618\nTherefore, the answer is: {Answer: B}.\n"

So, if we assume that the original amount of food in the bowl was 100%, then after the first feeding session, 2/3 of the food was left (100% - 1/3*100% = 2/3*100%). After the second feeding session, 2/3 of the remaining food was left, which is (2/3)*2/3*100% = 4/9*100%. After the third feeding session, 2/3 of the remaining food was left, which is (2/3)*(4/9)*100% = 8/27*100%.
