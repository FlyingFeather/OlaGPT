            "explanation": "Explanation :\nLet the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/√3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)\nh / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)\nSo, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\nAnswer : A",

What percent more than its wholesale cost was the appliance sold for?\nThe percent increase from wholesale cost to selling price is (selling price - wholesale cost)/wholesale cost * 100%.\nSubstituting the values we got in step 1 and 2, we get ((1.28x - x)/x) * 100% = 28%.\nAnswer: {Answer: B)28%}.\n",

Find the investment of C.\n- C joined after B, so he invested for 10 - x months (where x is the number of months after B joined).\n- Total investment of C = Rs.120,000 * (10 - x)\n\n3. Find the total profit of A, B, and C.\n- Total investment of A, B, and C = Rs.1,080,000 + Rs.120,000 * (10 - x) = Rs.1,200,000 - Rs.120,000x\n- C gets Rs.150,000 as his share, so A and B get Rs.375,000 - Rs.150,000 = Rs.225,000 as their share.\n- Profit of A and B = Rs.225,000 - (Rs.1,200,000 - Rs.120,000x) = Rs.120,000x - Rs.75,000\n\n4. Solve for x.\n- We know that C invested for 10 - x months and got Rs.150,000 as his share.\n- So, his share per month = Rs.150,000 / (10 - x)\n- We also know that A and B's share per month is Rs.120,000x - Rs.75,000.\n- Setting these two equal, we get: Rs.150,000 / (10 - x) = Rs.120,000x - Rs.75,000\n- Solving for x, we get x = 4.\n\nTherefore, C joined the business 4 months after B did.\n\nThe answer is: {Answer: B)4 months}.\n",

Then, A worked for the entire year, B worked for (12-2) = 10 months, and C worked for (12-x) months.\n\nThe ratio of their investments is:\nA : B : C\n= 40000*12 : 60000*10 : 120000*(12-x)\n= 480000 : 600000 : 1440000-120000x\n= 8 : 10 : 24-2x\n\nLet's assume that the total profit is divided into 42 parts (8+10+24). Then, C's share is 24/42 of the total profit, which is equal to Rs.150,000.\n\nTherefore, the total profit is:\n42 parts = Rs.375,000\n1 part = Rs.375,000/42\nC's share = 24 parts = 24*(375000/42) = Rs. 214,285.71\n\nNow we can set up a proportion to find x:\nC's share : Total profit = C's months : Total months worked by C\n214285.71 : 375000 = (12-x)/10\nx = 4\n\nTherefore, C joined the business 4 months after B joined.\nThe answer is: {Answer: \"B)4 months\"}.\n"

Let the total time taken for the trip be t hours.\\n5. 3 hours before the end of the trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. So, he had covered (x - 70) miles in (t - 3) hours.\\n6.

Answer: {Answer: C)270}.\\n#pt: PlanThought: planning_thought: Let's use the formula distance = speed x time to solve this problem. We need to find the distance between A and B, so we can use the formula twice, once for each leg of the trip. We also need to use the fact that Kevin was 70 miles away from B, 3 hours before the end of his trip.\\n\\nLet's start with the first leg of the trip, from A to B. We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph, so we can use the formula distance = speed x time to find the distance he covered in this leg. Let's call this distance d1.\\n\\nd1 = 70 x t1\\n\\nNow let's move on to the second leg of the trip, from B back to A. We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 90 mph, so we can use the same formula to find the distance he covered in this leg. Let's call this distance d2.\\n\\nd2 = 90 x t2\\n\\nWe also know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was still approaching B and was only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already covered d1 + d2 - 70 miles of the total distance between A and B. We can use this information to set up an equation:\\n\\nd1 + d2 - 70 = total distance\\n\\nNow we can substitute the expressions we found for d1 and d2 into this equation:\\n\\n70t1 + 90t2 - 70 = total distance\\n\\nWe also know that Kevin's total trip took a certain amount of time, which we can call t. We can use this information to set up another equation:\\n\\nt = t1 + t2 + 3\\n\\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (total distance and t2), which we can solve using algebra.

So, he had covered (x - 70) miles in (t - 3) hours.\n6. Using the formula: distance = speed * time, we get:\n    - Distance covered while going from A to B = x miles.\n    - Distance covered while returning from B to A = x miles.\n    - Distance covered in the last 3 hours = (x - 70) miles.\n    - Total distance = x + x + (x - 70) = 3x - 70 miles.\n7.

                "dt: DecompositionThought: Let's think with disaggregated_thought:\n1. Let the height of the room be 2x and semi-perimeter be 5y.\n2. Then, length of the room = 5y - 2x and breadth of the room = 3y - 2x.\n3. Total area to be covered with paper = 2(5y - 2x)(2x) + 2(3y - 2x)(2x) = 26xy.\n4. Area covered by doors and windows = 15 sq.m = 1500 sq.cm.\n5. Area to be covered with paper = Total area - Area covered by doors and windows = 2600 - 1500 = 1100 sq.cm.\n6. Width of the paper = 50 cm = 0.5 m and cost of paper = Rs.2 per meter.\n7. Length of paper required = Area to be covered with paper / Width of paper = 1100 / 50 = 22 m.\n8. Cost of papering the walls = Length of paper required * Cost of paper per meter = 22 * 2 = Rs.44.\n9. But, it is given that cost of papering the walls = Rs.260.\n10. Therefore, cost of painting the walls = Rs.260 - Rs.44 = Rs.216.\n11. Now, using the ratios, we get 2x / 5y = 2 / 7.\n12. Solving the above equation, we get x / y = 5 / 7.\n13. Also, area of the room = height * semi-perimeter = 2x * 5y = 10xy.\n14. Solving the above equation and substituting x / y = 5 / 7, we get area of the room = 50 / 7 sq.m.\n15. Area covered by doors and windows = 15 sq.m.\n16. Area to be painted = Area of the room - Area covered by doors and windows = (50 / 7) - 15 = (5 / 7) sq.m.\n17. Let the length, breadth and height of the room be L, B and H respectively.\n18. Then, LBH = (5 / 7) * 1000 (converting sq.m to sq.cm).\n19. Also, 2(LH + BH) = semi-perimeter * 100 (converting m to cm).\n20. Substituting L = 5y - 2x, B = 3y - 2x and H = 2x, we get the equation: (5y - 2x)(2x) + (3y - 2x)(2x) = 250 - 5y.\n21. Solving the above equation, we get y = 10 and x = 5.\n22. Therefore, height of the room = 2x = 10 m.\nAnswer: {Answer: D)4.2m}.\n",

Therefore, the number of files not infected by a virus is 250 - 125 = 125. \\n\\nWe can now use the information about W and VW to find the number of files infected by a worm. Since W = 2.5VW, we know that VW = W/2.5. Therefore, the total number of files infected by a worm is W + VW = 3.5VW. \\n\\nWe can set up an equation using the information we have: V + W + VW = 250.
