Determine the unknown information: Distance travelled by the jeep.\n4. Determine the formula to use: Distance = Speed x Time\n5. Solve for the distance travelled during the forward journey: \n   - Let the speed during the forward journey be x km/hr\n   - Distance = Speed x Time = x km/hr x 6 hours = 6x km\n6. Solve for the speed during the return journey: \n   - Let the speed during the return journey be y km/hr\n   - y = x + 12 km/hr (since the speed increased by 12km/hr)\n7. Solve for the distance travelled during the return journey: \n   - Distance = Speed x Time = y km/hr x 4 hours = 4y km\n8. Add the distances travelled during the forward and return journeys to get the total distance travelled by the jeep: \n   - Total distance = 6x km + 4y km\n9. Substitute y = x + 12 km/hr into the equation for total distance: \n   - Total distance = 6x km + 4(x + 12) km\n   - Total distance = 6x km + 4x km + 48 km\n   - Total distance = 10x km + 48 km\n10. Set up an equation using the given information to solve for x: \n   - Distance = Speed x Time\n   - 6x = Distance\n   - 4(x + 12) = Distance\n   - Since the distances are equal, we can set the two equations equal to each other:\n   - 6x = 4(x + 12)\n   - 6x = 4x + 48\n   - 2x = 48\n   - x = 24 km/hr\n11. Substitute x = 24 km/hr into the equation for total distance: \n   - Total distance = 10x km + 48 km\n   - Total distance = 10(24) km + 48 km\n   - Total distance = 240 km + 48 km\n   - Total distance = 288 km\n12. Select the correct answer from the choices: \n   - {Answer: D}\n",
                "pt: PlanThought: To solve this problem, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time. \n\nLet's assume the speed of the jeep during the forward journey is S km/hr and the distance it travels is D km. \n\nFrom the given information, we know that: \n\nS x 6 = D  (equation 1) \n\nDuring the return journey, the speed of the jeep is (S + 12) km/hr and the time taken is 4 hours. \n\nSo, the distance travelled during the return journey is: \n\n(S + 12) x 4 = 4S + 48 \n\nWe also know that the distance travelled during the return journey is the same as the distance travelled during the forward journey. \n\nTherefore, \n\nD = 4S + 48  (equation 2) \n\nNow we can solve for S by substituting equation 1 into equation 2: \n\n4S + 48 = 6S \n\n2S = 48 \n\nS = 24 \n\nSubstituting S = 24 into equation 1, we get: \n\nD = S x 6 = 24 x 6 = 144 \n\nTherefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144 km. \n\n{Answer: B}\n",

Then, the amount contributed by each employee is (6,00,000/x). If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the amount contributed by each employee would be (6,00,000+60x)/x. According to the problem, these two amounts are equal. Therefore, we can form the equation:\\n6,00,000/x = (6,00,000+60x)/x\\n4. Solve the equation:\\n6,00,000/x = (6,00,000+60x)/x\\n6,00,000x = 6,00,000+60x^2\\n60x^2 - 6,00,000x + 6,00,000 = 0\\nx^2 - 10,000x + 10,000 = 0\\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\\nx = (10,000 ± √(10,000^2 - 4(1)(10,000)))/2\\nx = (10,000 ± 10,000)/2\\nx = 5,000 or x = 2,000\\nSince the number of employees cannot be negative, we reject x = 2,000.

Since the total amount of money exchanged is zero, we can set up an equation: 2x = 3y.\n4. We know that x + y = 20 (since the coin was flipped 20 times).\n5. We can use substitution to solve for x: 2x = 3(20 - x) -> 2x = 60 - 3x -> 5x = 60 -> x = 12.\n\nTherefore, the coin landed on Heads 12 times.\n\n{Answer: E}\n",

To find out the revenue from the sale of biographies, we need to subtract the revenue from the sale of novels from the total revenue and then multiply it by 1/3. \n\nFinally, we need to find out how many times the revenue from the sale of novels is compared to the revenue from the sale of biographies. We can do this by dividing the revenue from the sale of novels by the revenue from the sale of biographies. \n\nUsing this plan, we can solve the problem as follows: \n\nRevenue from the sale of novels = 34/100 x Total revenue \n\nRevenue from the sale of biographies = 1/3 x (Total revenue - Revenue from the sale of novels) \n\nRevenue from the sale of novels / Revenue from the sale of biographies = (34/100 x Total revenue) / (1/3 x (Total revenue - 34/100 x Total revenue)) \n\nSimplifying this expression, we get: \n\nRevenue from the sale of novels / Revenue from the sale of biographies = 1.5 \n\nTherefore, the revenue from the sale of novels was approximately 1.5 times the revenue from the sale of biographies. \n\nThe answer is {Answer: B}.\n",

Once we have the base and height, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle. \n\nUsing this planning thought, we can solve the problem as follows:\n\nThe base of the triangle is |a-b|. To find the height, we need to find the equation of the line passing through (a,0) and (b,0). The slope of this line is 0, so the equation is simply y=0. The distance from (x,y) to this line is the absolute value of the difference between y and 0, which is |y|. Therefore, the height of the triangle is |y|.\n\nThe area of the triangle is (1/2) * base * height. Substituting the values we found, we get:\n\n(1/2) * |a-b| * |y|\n\nSince a>x>b>0>y, we know that a-b and y are both negative. Therefore, we can simplify the expression as follows:\n\n(1/2) * (b-a) * (-y)\n\n= (1/2) * (a-b) * y\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{Answer: A}\n",

Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.\n=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.\n=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)\n=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x\n=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x\n=> y = 315 - (9/7)x\n=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,\nx = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153\nx = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144\nx = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135\nx = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126\nAs we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs.

Total time taken by Alex = 7 hours/toy x number of toys made by Alex\n   Total time taken by Jacob = 9 hours/toy x number of toys made by Jacob\n   Total time taken by both = Total time taken by Alex + Total time taken by Jacob\n   Total time taken by both = 7x + 9y (where x and y are the number of toys made by Alex and Jacob respectively)\n   Total time taken by both = 7(x+y) (since both of them made 35 toys in total)\n   Therefore, 7(x+y) = 7x + 9y\n   Simplifying, we get 2y = 28 - x\n\n2. Ratio of time taken by Alex and Jacob = 7:9\n   Ratio of toys made by Alex and Jacob = 9:7 (inverse of time ratio)\n\n3. Let's assume that Jacob made z toys.\n   Therefore, Alex made 35 - z toys.\n   Using the ratio of toys made by Alex and Jacob, we get:\n   9/7 = (35-z)/z\n   Solving for z, we get z = 18\n\nTherefore, Jacob made 18 toys.\n\nAnswer: {Answer: D}\n",
                "pt: PlanThought: First, we need to use the given information to set up an equation. Let x be the number of toys made by Alex and y be the number of toys made by Jacob. We know that:\n\nx + y = 35 (since they made 35 toys in total)\n7x + 9y = total number of hours worked by both of them\n\nSince we know that both of them worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that their total number of hours worked is roughly the same. Let's say that they worked for a total of 16 hours (which is between 7 and 9). Then we can set up another equation:\n\n7x + 9y = 16\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for y by using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:\n\nx + y = 35\nx = 35 - y\n\n7x + 9y = 16\n7(35 - y) + 9y = 16\n245 - 7y + 9y = 16\n2y = 229\ny = 114.5\n\nUh oh, we got a decimal answer for y. This doesn't make sense since y represents the number of toys made by Jacob, which should be a whole number. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nWe assumed that they worked for a total of 16 hours, but this may not be correct. Let's try a different total number of hours worked. If we assume that they worked for a total of 63 hours (which is a multiple of both 7 and 9), then we can set up the following equation:\n\n7x + 9y = 63\n\nUsing substitution again:\n\nx + y = 35\nx = 35 - y\n\n7x + 9y = 63\n7(35 - y) + 9y = 63\n245 - 7y + 9y = 63\n2y = 182\ny = 91\n\nThis makes more sense! Jacob made 91 toys. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {Answer: C}.\n",

Identify the information given in the problem:\n- 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001.\n- 500 deer were caught at random during 2002.\n- Only 20 of the 500 deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year.\n- The percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags.\n- No change in population between 2001 and 2002.\n\n2. Determine the percentage of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample:\n- 20 tagged deer out of 500 deer caught = 4% tagged deer in the 500 deer sample.\n\n3. Use the percentage of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample to estimate the total number of tagged deer in the forest:\n- If 4% of the 500 deer sample were tagged, then it is assumed that 4% of the total deer population in the forest were tagged.\n- Let x be the total deer population in the forest.\n- 4% of x = 300 tagged deer in 2001 + 20 tagged deer in 2002\n- 0.04x = 320\n- x = 8,000\n\n4.

                "pt: PlanThought: To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to estimate the total deer population in the forest. We know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001 and that only 20 of the 500 deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year. This means that the percentage of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample is approximately (20/500) * 100 = 4%.\n\nIf we assume that this percentage is representative of the entire deer population in the forest, we can set up a proportion to solve for the total population:\n\n4/100 = 300/x\n\nwhere x is the total deer population. Solving for x, we get:\n\nx = (300 * 100)/4 = 7500\n\nTherefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500.\n\nAnswer: {Answer: E}\n",

Understand the problem: We have a square piece of cloth that is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece. This rectangular piece is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. We know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. We need to find the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth.\\n\\n2. Make a plan: \\n- Let's start by finding the area of the rectangular piece. We know that one edge is 4 feet shorter than the other, so let's call the longer edge x and the shorter edge x-4. The area of the rectangle is then x(x-4) = x^2 - 4x.\\n- We also know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. The formula for the area of a triangle is (base x height) / 2. Since the two triangles are identical, we can set up the equation: (x-4)(h)/2 = 70, where h is the height of the triangle.\\n- Solving for h, we get h = 140 / (x-4).\\n- Now we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal of the rectangle, which is also the hypotenuse of each triangle. The formula is a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the two sides of the rectangle and c is the diagonal. We know that a = x-4 and b = h, so we can substitute and simplify: (x-4)^2 + (140/(x-4))^2 = c^2.\\n- Finally, we need to find the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth, which is 4x.\\n\\n3. Solve the problem:\\n- We can use algebra or a graphing calculator to solve the equation (x-4)^2 + (140/(x-4))^2 = c^2. The solution is x = 18 or x = 10. We can discard x = 10 since it would make the shorter edge negative.\\n- So the longer edge of the rectangle is 18 feet, and the shorter edge is 14 feet. The diagonal of the rectangle is then c = sqrt(18^2 + 14^2) = 22 feet.\\n- The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x = 4(18) = 72 feet.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is {Answer: D}.\\n#turbo: GPT: {Answer: D}\\n\", \"llm_task_type\": \"word problem\"}",

Use the length and width of the rectangular piece to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nAnswer: {Answer: D} (62)\n",
                "pt: PlanThought: To solve this problem, we need to use planning_thought. \n\n1. Understand the problem: We have a square piece of cloth that is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece. This rectangular piece is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. We know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. We need to find the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth.\n\n2. Make a plan: \n- Let's start by finding the area of the rectangular piece. We know that one edge is 4 feet shorter than the other, so let's call the longer edge x and the shorter edge x-4. The area of the rectangle is then x(x-4) = x^2 - 4x.\n- We also know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. The formula for the area of a triangle is (base x height) / 2. Since the two triangles are identical, we can set up the equation: (x-4)(h)/2 = 70, where h is the height of the triangle.\n- Solving for h, we get h = 140 / (x-4).\n- Now we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal of the rectangle, which is also the hypotenuse of each triangle. The formula is a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the two sides of the rectangle and c is the diagonal. We know that a = x-4 and b = h, so we can substitute and simplify: (x-4)^2 + (140/(x-4))^2 = c^2.\n- Finally, we need to find the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth, which is 4x.\n\n3. Solve the problem:\n- We can use algebra or a graphing calculator to solve the equation (x-4)^2 + (140/(x-4))^2 = c^2. The solution is x = 18 or x = 10. We can discard x = 10 since it would make the shorter edge negative.\n- So the longer edge of the rectangle is 18 feet, and the shorter edge is 14 feet. The diagonal of the rectangle is then c = sqrt(18^2 + 14^2) = 22 feet.\n- The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x = 4(18) = 72 feet.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {Answer: D}.\n",

The area of the field can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle: A = πr^2, where r is the length of the rope. Therefore, A = π(14/2)^2 = 153.94 sq.ft.\n2. Divide the area of the field by the grazing area per day: 153.94/10 = 15.394 days.\n3. Round up the answer to the nearest whole number: 16 days.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {Answer: D}.\n",

Calculate the investment made by C: \n   Investment made by C = Total investment - (Rs.150,000 * 12) = Rs.1,500,000 - Rs.1,800,000 = Rs.300,000\n\n3. Calculate the time period for which C was in the business: \n   Profit share of C = Rs.150,000\n   Total profit = Rs.375,000\n   Profit share of C / Total profit = Investment made by C / Total investment\n   Rs.150,000 / Rs.375,000 = Rs.300,000 / Rs.1,080,000\n   Solving this equation, we get the time period for which C was in the business as 8 months.\n\n4. Calculate the time period for which B was in the business before C joined: \n   Total time period = 12 months\n   Time period for which C was in the business = 8 months\n   Time period for which B was in the business before C joined = Total time period - Time period for which C was in the business = 12 - 8 = 4 months\n\nTherefore, the answer is {Answer: B}.

Use the total area and the dimensions of the room to find the height of the room.\\n\\nExecution:\\n1. Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5y.\\n2. Then, the perimeter of the room is 2(2x) + 2(5y)/2 = 4x + 5y.\\n3. Let the length, width, and height of the room be L, W, and 2x, respectively.\\n4. Then, 2x(L+W) = 4x + 5y.\\n5. Solving for L+W, we get L+W = (4x+5y)/(2x) = 2 + 5/2 = 9/2.\\n6. Also, LW = (4x+5y)y/2x = 5y^2/2x.\\n7. Subtracting the area of doors and windows (15 sq.m) from the total area of the walls (2xL + 2xW + LW), we get 2xL + 2xW + LW - 15 = 2x(9/2) + 5y^2/2x - 15.\\n8.

Make a plan to solve the problem.\n4. Execute the plan and solve the problem.\n\nGiven: \n- The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.\n- It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter.\n- Allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows.\n\nTo find: The height of the room.\n\nPlan:\n1. Use the given ratio of height to semi-perimeter to find the height in terms of the perimeter.\n2. Use the perimeter to find the dimensions of the room.\n3. Subtract the area of doors and windows from the total area of the walls to find the area to be covered with paper.\n4. Use the area and width of the paper to find the length of paper required.\n5. Use the cost per meter and length of paper to find the total cost of papering the walls.\n6. Use the total cost and the cost per square meter to find the total area of the walls.\n7. Use the total area and the dimensions of the room to find the height of the room.\n\nExecution:\n1. Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5y.\n2. Then, the perimeter of the room is 2(2x) + 2(5y)/2 = 4x + 5y.\n3. Let the length, width, and height of the room be L, W, and 2x, respectively.\n4. Then, 2x(L+W) = 4x + 5y.\n5. Solving for L+W, we get L+W = (4x+5y)/(2x) = 2 + 5/2 = 9/2.\n6. Also, LW = (4x+5y)y/2x = 5y^2/2x.\n7. Subtracting the area of doors and windows (15 sq.m) from the total area of the walls (2xL + 2xW + LW), we get 2xL + 2xW + LW - 15 = 2x(9/2) + 5y^2/2x - 15.\n8. Simplifying, we get LW = 5x^2 - 20x + 25y^2 - 60.\n9. Using the width of the paper (50cm = 0.5m), we get the length of paper required as (2xL + 2xW + LW)/0.5 = 4x + 4.5y^2/x - 120.\n10. Using the cost per meter (Rs.2), we get the total cost of papering the walls as 2(4x + 4.5y^2/x - 120) = 8x + 9y^2/x - 240.\n11. Using the total cost (Rs.260), we get the total area of the walls as (260-240)/2 = 10 sq.m.\n12. Using the dimensions of the room (L = 9/2 - W), we get the total area of the walls as 2xL + 2xW = 9x.\n13. Equating the total area of the walls to 10 sq.m, we get 9x = 10.\n14. Solving for x, we get x = 10/9.\n15. Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 20/9 = 2.22m.\n\nAnswer: {Answer: A} (2.6m is not one of the options given in the choices.)\n",

Also, we know that:\n         t1 + t3 = t2 + t4\n   q. Solving the above two equations, we get:\n         t1 + t3 = 4t2 + 4t4 - 4\n   r. Substituting this value in equation (o), we get:\n         78t2 + 78t4 - 72 = 54t1 + 54t3 + 48\n   s. Simplifying the above equation, we get:\n         39t2 + 39t4 - 36 = 27t1 + 27t3 + 24\n   t. Dividing both sides by 3, we get:\n         13t2 + 13t4 - 12 = 9t1 + 9t3 + 8\n   u. We also know that:\n         Distance covered by Allen when they meet for the second time = Distance covered by Bob when they meet for the second time - 48 km\n   v. Substituting the values of distances and times in the above equation, we get:\n         54(t1 + t3) = 78(t2 + t4) - 48\n   w. Simplifying the above equation, we get:\n         27t1 + 27t3 = 39t2 + 39t4 - 24\n   x. Dividing both sides by 3, we get:\n         9t1 + 9t3 = 13t2 + 13t4 - 8\n   y. Adding equations (t) and (x), we get:\n         22t1 + 22t3 = 26t2 + 26t4 - 20\n   z. Dividing both sides by 2, we get:\n         11t1 + 11t3 = 13t2 + 13t4 - 10\n   aa. Adding 10 to both sides, we get:\n         11t1 + 11t3 + 10 = 13t2 + 13t4\n   ab. Dividing both sides by 13, we get:\n         t2 + t4 = (11t1 + 11t3 + 10) / 13\n   ac. Substituting this value in equation (o), we get:\n         78t2 + 78t4 = 54t1 + 54t3 + 120\n   ad. Dividing both sides by 6, we get:\n         13t2 + 13t4 = 9t1 + 9t3 + 20\n   ae. Substituting the value of t2 + t4 from equation (ab), we get:\n         13((11t1 + 11t3 + 10) / 13) = 9t1 + 9t3 + 20\n   af. Simplifying the above equation, we get:\n         11t1 + 11t3 + 10 = 9t1 + 9t3 + 20\n   ag. Simplifying further, we get:\n         2t1 + 2t3 = 5\n   ah. Dividing both sides by 2, we get:\n         t1 + t3 = 2.5\n   ai. Substituting this value in equation (p), we get:\n         2(t1 + t3) = 2(t2 + t4)\n   aj. Substituting the value of t1 + t3 from equation (ah), we get:\n         5 = 2(t2 + t4)\n   ak. Dividing both sides by 2, we get:\n         t2 + t4 = 2.5\n   al. Substituting the values of t1, t2, t3, and t4 in the expressions for distances, we get:\n         Distance covered by Allen = 54t1 + 54t3 = 54(1.25) + 54(1.25) = 135 km\n         Distance covered by Bob = 78t2 + 78t4 = 78(1.25) + 78(1.25) = 195 km\n   am. Therefore, the distance between X and Y is:\n         Distance between X and Y = Distance covered by Allen + Distance covered by Bob = 135 + 195 = 330 km\n5. Select the answer:\n   {Answer: A}\n",
                "pt: PlanThought: Using planning_thought:\n\n1. Understand the problem: Two people start from two different points and move towards each other, then change direction and move towards their starting points. We need to find the distance between the two points.\n2. Make a plan: \n- Let the distance between X and Y be d km.\n- Let t1 be the time taken for Allen to reach Y.\n- Let t2 be the time taken for Bob to reach X.\n- Let t3 be the time taken for Allen to return to X.\n- Let t4 be the time taken for Bob to return to Y.\n- Write down the equations for the distances travelled by Allen and Bob.\n- Use the fact that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen to form another equation.\n- Solve the equations to find d.\n3. Execute the plan: \n\nLet's start by writing down the equations for the distances travelled by Allen and Bob:\n\nDistance travelled by Allen = 54t1 + 54t3\nDistance travelled by Bob = 78t2 + 78t4\n\nSince they meet for the second time, we know that the total time taken by both of them is the same. Therefore:\n\nt1 + t2 = t3 + t4\n\nWe also know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Therefore:\n\n78t2 + 78t4 = 54t1 + 54t3 + 48\n\nSubstituting t2 = t3 + t4 - t1 into the above equation, we get:\n\n78(t3 + t4 - t1) + 78t4 = 54t1 + 54t3 + 48\n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\n\n132t3 + 126t4 = 54t1 + 78t2 + 48\n\nSubstituting t1 + t2 = t3 + t4 into the above equation, we get:\n\n132t3 + 126t4 = 54(t1 + t2) + 48\n\nSubstituting t1 + t2 = t3 + t4 = (d/54 + d/78) into the above equation, we get:\n\n132t3 + 126t4 = 54(d/54 + d/78) + 48\n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\n\n22d = 936\n\nTherefore, d = 42 km.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{Answer: D}\n",

Calculate the profit earned by the company.\n7. Calculate the cost of manufacturing each non-defective pen.\n\nSolution:\n1. Total number of pens produced = 7200/0.9 = 8000 pens\n2. Number of defective pens = 8000 x 0.1 = 800 pens\n3. Number of non-defective pens = 8000 - 800 = 7200 pens\n4. Total revenue earned = 7200 x Rs. 10 = Rs. 72,000\n5. Let the cost of manufacturing each pen be Rs. x\n    Total cost of manufacturing all pens = 8000 x Rs. x\n6. Profit earned = Total revenue - Total cost\n                  = Rs. 72,000 - 8000x\n                  = 0.25(8000x)\n                  = 2000x\n    Therefore, 2000x = Rs. 72,000 - 8000x\n                      = 10000x = Rs. 72,000\n                      x = Rs. 7.2\n7.

                "pt: PlanThought: planning_thought: To find the manufactured cost of each pen, we need to consider the profit margin and the percentage of defective pens. \n\nCalculations: \n\nLet the cost of manufacturing one pen be x. \n\nGiven, the company promises to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. \n\nSo, the revenue earned by the company = 7200 x 10 = Rs. 72,000 \n\nThe overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. \n\nTherefore, the cost of manufacturing all the pens = (100/125) x 72,000 = Rs. 57,600 \n\nNow, we need to consider the percentage of defective pens. \n\n10% of the produced pens are always defective, so the number of defective pens = 10% of 7200 = 720 \n\nThe revenue lost due to defective pens = 720 x 10 = Rs. 7200 \n\nTherefore, the revenue earned by the company after deducting the revenue lost due to defective pens = 72,000 - 7200 = Rs. 64,800 \n\nWe know that the cost of manufacturing all the pens = Rs. 57,600 \n\nSo, the cost of manufacturing 7200 - 720 = 6480 pens = Rs. 57,600 \n\nTherefore, the cost of manufacturing one pen = 57,600/6480 = Rs. 8.88 (approx) \n\nHence, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 8. \n\nAnswer: {Answer: D}\n",

Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, we can assume that half of the volume is aluminum and the other half is silver. \\n\\nLet x be the radius of the coin.

We know that the weight of the coin is 30 grams, so we can use the density formula:\\n\\ndensity = mass/volume\\n\\nto find the density of the alloy. \\n\\nLet ρa be the density of aluminum and ρs be the density of silver. Then, we have:\\n\\n30 = (1/2)πx^2(2ρa + 2ρs)\\n\\nSimplifying, we get:\\n\\n15 = πx^2(ρa + ρs)\\n\\nWe also know that ρs = 2ρa, so we can substitute:\\n\\n15 = πx^2(3ρa)\\n\\nSolving for ρa, we get:\\n\\nρa = 5/(πx^2)\\n\\nNow we can find the weight of the pure aluminum coin.
