To do this, we need to find the value of x and v. We can use the fact that it takes 10 minutes (or 1/6 hours) for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°.

Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/√3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)\nh / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)\nSo, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\nAnswer : A",

                "dst: DecompositionThought: Let's think with disassemble_thought: Let the height of the tower be h and the distance of the car from the base of the tower be x. Then, we have:\n\nh/x = tan 45° = 1\nh/(x + vt) = tan 60°\n\nwhere v is the speed of the car and t is the additional time taken to reach the base of the tower. Simplifying this equation, we get:\n\nh = (x + vt)√3\nh = x√3 + vt√3\n\nSubstituting the value of h from the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\nx + vt = x√3 + vt√3\nt = (x√3 - x)/v\n\nWe need to find the value of t. To do this, we need to find the value of x and v. We can use the fact that it takes 10 minutes (or 1/6 hours) for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. This means that the car covers a distance equal to the height of the tower in 1/6 hours. Therefore, we have:\n\nh = vt/6\nh = x√2/2\n\nEquating these two expressions for h, we get:\n\nvt/6 = x√2/2\nv = 3x√2\n\nSubstituting the value of v into the expression for t, we get:\n\nt = (x√3 - x)/(3x√2)\nt = (√3/3 - 1/√2)t\n\nSolving for t, we get:\n\nt = 6(√3 + √2)\n\nAnswer: B.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: {Answer: B).\n",

Therefore, we have:\ntime = d/v = h(2 - √3)/v\nWe know that the time taken for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60° is 10 minutes or 1/6 hours.

In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).\nAt this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.\nLooking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)\nAs a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.\nPlug-in n=4 to (n + nC2) = (4 + 4C2) = 4 + (4x3 /2) = (4 + 6) = 10 ANS:D",

                "pt: PlanThought: Let's think with planning_thought: The area of the square paper is (20)^2 = 400 sq.cm. The diameter of each semi-circle is 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm. The area of each semi-circle is (1/2)πr^2 = (1/2)π(10)^2 = 50π/2 = 25π sq.cm. Therefore, the total area of the two semi-circles is 50π sq.cm. When these semi-circles are cut down, the remaining paper is in the shape of a square with two quarter circles in opposite corners. The side of this square is 20 - 10 - 10 = 0 cm, so its area is 0 sq.cm. The area of each quarter circle is (1/4)πr^2 = (1/4)π(10)^2 = 25π/4 sq.cm. Therefore, the total area of the two quarter circles is 25π/2 sq.cm. The area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the area of the two quarter circles, which is 400 - 25π/2 sq.cm. Using a calculator, we get the answer to be approximately 8.79 sq.cm. Therefore, the answer is: {Answer: B)8.79}.\n"

We also know that the company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each and estimates an overall profit of 25% on all the manufactured pens. We can use this information to calculate the manufacturing cost of each pen.\n\nSolution: \n\nLet the manufacturing cost of each pen be x.\n\nTotal number of pens produced = 7200/0.9 = 8000 (since 10% are defective and rejected)\n\nTotal revenue from selling 8000 pens at Rs. 10 each = 8000 x 10 = Rs. 80,000\n\nOverall profit on all the manufactured pens = 25%\n\nTherefore, total cost of manufacturing 8000 pens = (100/125) x 80,000 = Rs. 64,000\n\nCost of manufacturing each pen = 64,000/8000 = Rs. 8\n\nTherefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 8.\n\nAnswer: {Answer: D)Rs. 8}.\n"

There are 4C2 * 4C1 = 24 ways to do this. \n\nCase 3: Select one candy bar that costs $2, one candy bar that costs $1, and one candy bar that costs 50 cents. There are 4C1 * 3C1 * 3C1 = 36 ways to do this. \n\nThe total number of ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost of more than $4 is 4 + 24 + 36 = 64. \n\nThe total number of ways to select 3 candy bars from the 11 candy bars is 11C3 = 165. \n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting 3 candy bars with a total cost of more than $4 is 64/165. \n\nAnswer: {Answer: \"D)66\"}.\n"
