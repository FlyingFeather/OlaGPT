            "explanation": "Explanation :\nLet the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/√3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)\nh / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)\nSo, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\nAnswer : A",

            "explanation": "The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).\nAt this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.\nLooking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)\nAs a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.\nPlug-in n=4 to (n + nC2) = (4 + 4C2) = 4 + (4x3 /2) = (4 + 6) = 10 ANS:D",

            "explanation": "Explanation:\nSuppose the merchant will take advantage of the cash discount of 4% of $20 000 = $800 by paying the bill within 30 days from the date of invoice. He needs to borrow $20 000 = $800 = $19 200. He would borrow this money on day 30 and repay it on day 100 (the day the original invoice is due) resulting in a 70-day loan. The interest he should be willing to pay on borrowed money should not exceed the cash discount $800.\nr=I/pt=21.73%\nThe highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 21.73%. This is a break-even rate. If he can borrow money, say at a rate of 15%, he should do so. He would borrow $19 200 for 70 days at 15%. Maturity value of the loan is $19 200(1+0.15(70/365))=$19 752.33\nsavings would be $20 000 − $19 752.33 = $247.67\nAnswer: A",

                "dst: DecompositionThought: Let's think with disassemble_thought: \nTo find the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to find the number of integers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000 and divide it by the total number of integers in S. \nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of 1,000: 1,000 = 2^3 * 5^3. \nThe number of integers in S that are not relatively prime to 1,000 are those that have either 2 or 5 as a factor. \nThe number of integers in S that have 2 as a factor is 500 (every other integer in S has 2 as a factor). \nThe number of integers in S that have 5 as a factor is 200 (every 5th integer in S has 5 as a factor). \nHowever, we have double-counted the integers that have both 2 and 5 as factors (i.e. multiples of 10). \nThe number of integers in S that have both 2 and 5 as factors is 100 (every 10th integer in S has both 2 and 5 as factors). \nTherefore, the number of integers in S that are not relatively prime to 1,000 is 500 + 200 - 100 = 600. \nThe number of integers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000 is 1,000 - 600 = 400. \nSo the probability of choosing a number from S that is relatively prime to 1,000 is 400/1000 = 2/5. \nTherefore, the answer is: {\"Answer\": \"D)2/5\"}.\n"

So, the distance is 20 x 0.15 = 3 km.\n- Now, we can use the same formula to find the time it will take the worker to cycle at an average rate of 6 km/h for the same distance of 3 km.\n- time = distance / rate = 3 / 6 = 0.5 hours = 30 minutes.\nTherefore, the answer is: {Answer: A)30}.\n",
