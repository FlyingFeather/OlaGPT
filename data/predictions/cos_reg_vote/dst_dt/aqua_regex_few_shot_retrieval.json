                "dt: DecompositionThought: Let's think with disaggregated_thought: \nLet's call the first odd number x. Then the next four odd numbers are x+2, x+4, x+6, and x+8. \nThe sum of these five numbers is 5x+20, which can be written as 10n+k, where n is an integer and k is the perfect square. \nSo, 5x+20 = 10n+k, or 5(x+4) = 10n+k. \nDividing both sides by 5, we get x+4 = 2n + k/5. \nSince x is odd, k must be odd as well. The only odd perfect squares less than 20 are 1 and 9. \nIf k=1, then x+4 = 2n+1/5, which is not an integer. \nIf k=9, then x+4 = 2n+9/5, or x+4 = 2n+1. \nSo, x must be odd and congruent to 3 modulo 5. \nChecking the answer choices, we see that only 41 and 91 satisfy this condition. \nTherefore, the answer is: {\"Answer\": \"C)41\" or \"Answer\": \"B)91\"}.\n",
                "dst: DecompositionThought: disassemble_thought: \n\n- Let's start by finding the sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers. \n- We know that the numbers are consecutive odd numbers, so we can represent them as x, x+2, x+4, x+6, and x+8. \n- The sum of these numbers is 5x + 20. \n- We are told that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. \n- Let's represent the perfect square as y^2. \n- So, we have the equation 5x + 20 = 10y^2. \n- Simplifying this equation, we get x = 2y^2 - 4. \n- We also know that x is a two digit odd number. \n- Let's try plugging in the answer choices for y and see which ones give us a two digit odd number for x. \n\nSolution: \n\nLet's start by plugging in y = 1. \n\nx = 2y^2 - 4 = 2(1)^2 - 4 = -2 \n\nThis is not a two digit odd number, so we can eliminate options A, C, and E. \n\nLet's try y = 2. \n\nx = 2y^2 - 4 = 2(2)^2 - 4 = 8 \n\nThis is not an odd number, so we can eliminate option B. \n\nLet's try y = 3. \n\nx = 2y^2 - 4 = 2(3)^2 - 4 = 14 \n\nThis is not an odd number, so we can eliminate option D. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {Answer: C)41}.\n"

New cost per person = Rs. 96 / (x-4) (since 4 friends didn't turn up)\nEach person had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, so the total amount collected = Rs. 96 + (4 * (x-4))\nNew cost per person = (Rs. 96 + (4 * (x-4))) / (x-4)\n\n3. Difference between original and new cost per person = (Rs. 96 + (4 * (x-4))) / (x-4) - Rs. 96 / x\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\n= (16x - 384) / (x(x-4))\n\n4. Extra amount paid by each person = Rs. 4\nNumber of people who attended the picnic = Rs. 4 / ((16x - 384) / (x(x-4)))\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\n= x - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x that satisfies the above equation and is also one of the given options.\n\nLet's try option A:\nIf the number of people who attended the picnic was 8, then the original cost per person = Rs. 96 / 8 = Rs. 12\nNew cost per person = (Rs. 96 + (4 * 4)) / 4 = Rs. 28\nDifference between original and new cost per person = (28 - 12) = 16/8 = 2\nExtra amount paid by each person = Rs. 4\nNumber of people who attended the picnic = 8 - 4 = 4 (which is not possible)\n\nSimilarly, we can try the other options and see that none of them satisfy the equation x - 4 = (Rs. 4 / ((16x - 384) / (x(x-4)))).\n\nTherefore, there is no correct option among the given choices.\n\nThe answer is: {\"Answer\": \"None of the given options\"}\n\n",

After the second replacement, he has 72.25 ml of tea and 27.75 ml of milk.\nStep 3: John replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk.

                "dst: DecompositionThought: Let's think with disassemble_thought: Each book can be represented by either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. So, the total number of codes required will be equal to the number of single letters plus the number of pairs of letters. Let's assume there are x single letters and y pairs of letters. Then, we have:\n\nx + y = 10 (since there are 10 types of books)\n2y + x = 10 (since each pair of letters counts as 2 letters)\n\nSolving these equations, we get y = 3 and x = 7. Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need is 7 + 2(3) = 13. However, we are asked for the smallest number of letters, not the total number of codes. Since each pair of letters counts as 2 letters, we can reduce the number of pairs by using the same letter twice for some books. For example, we can use \"AA\" for one type of book instead of a pair of different letters. This reduces the number of pairs by 1 and the number of letters by 1. We can do this for 3 types of books, so the smallest number of letters required is 13 - 3 = 10.\n\nAnswer: {Answer: D)10}.\n"

            "explanation": "If Q has 5 factors, we can represent Q = a^4, where a is positive integer more than 1.Let's assume that \"a\" is not a prime number. Let a = kp, where both k and p are positive integers.\nThus, Q = (kp)4=k4∗p4(kp)4=k4∗p4. Now the number of factors of Q = (4+1)*(4+1) = 25. But as the given condition states that Q has ONLY 5 factors, thus \"a\" can't have any other factor except 1 and itself. Thus, a = prime number.\nStatement I :We can represent Q = (a^2)^2. Thus, we have to prove whether a^2 is a prime number. Take a=2. We can see that it is not a prime number. Thus, this option can't answer a \"MUST be true question\"\nStatement II : Always true as proved above.\nStatement III : Again take a =2. Thus, Q = 64.
